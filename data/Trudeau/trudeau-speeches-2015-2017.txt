Mr. Speaker –

One of the greatest choices a person can make in their life is the choice to serve their fellow citizens. Maybe it’s in government, in the military, or in a police force. In whatever capacity one serves, dedicating your life to making Canada – and indeed, the world – a better place is a calling of the highest order.

Now imagine, if you will, being told that the very country you would willingly lay down your life to defend doesn’t want you. Doesn’t accept you. Sees you as defective. Sees you as a threat to our national security.

Not because you can’t do the job, or because you lack patriotism or courage – no, because of who you are as a person, and because of who your sexual partners are.

Now imagine, Mr. Speaker, being subjected to laws, policies, and hiring practices that label you as different – as “less than”.

Imagine having to fight for the basic rights that your peers enjoy, over and over again.

And imagine being criminalized for being who you are.

This is the truth for many of the Canadians present in the Gallery today, and those listening across the country.

This is the devastating story of people who were branded criminals by the government. People who lost their livelihoods, and in some cases, their lives.

These aren’t distant practices of Governments long forgotten. This happened systematically, in Canada, with a timeline more recent than any of us would like to admit.

Mr. Speaker, today we acknowledge an often-overlooked part of Canada’s history. Today, we finally talk about Canada’s role in the systemic oppression, criminalization, and violence against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and two-spirit communities.

And it is my hope that in talking about these injustices, vowing to never repeat them, and acting to right these wrongs, we can begin to heal.

Since arriving on these shores, settlers to this land brought with them foreign standards of right and wrong – of acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. Suitable and unsuitable partnerships.

They brought rigid gender norms – norms that manifested in homophobia and transphobia. Norms that saw the near-destruction of Indigenous LGBTQ and two-spirit identities. People who were once revered for their identities found themselves shamed for who they were. They were rejected and left vulnerable to violence.

And discrimination against LGBTQ2 communities was quickly codified in criminal offences like “buggery”, “gross indecency”, and bawdy house provisions.

Bathhouses were raided, people were entrapped by police.

Our laws bolstered and emboldened those who wanted to attack non-conforming sexual desire.

Our laws made private and consensual sex between same-sex partners a criminal offence, leading to the unjust arrest, conviction, and imprisonment of Canadians. This criminalization would have lasting impacts for things like employment, volunteering, and travel.

Those arrested and charged were purposefully and vindictively shamed. Their names appeared in newspapers in order to humiliate them, and their families.

Lives were destroyed. And tragically, lives were lost.

And this didn’t end in 1969 with the partial decriminalization of homosexual sex. Up until 1988, a twenty year old gay man who had sex with another man could still be convicted of a crime.

But the imprisonment and criminalization of LGBTQ2 individuals wasn’t the end of it. Other methods of oppression have been rampant throughout our society for generations.

Homophobia during the time of the AIDS crisis generated hysteria and propagated fear of gay men.

Books and magazines were stopped at the border under the guise of obscenity offences and customs regulations – the content of words and images deemed unacceptable.

And LGBTQ2 families have had to fight their own government for the right to benefits, and the freedom to marry, often at great personal cost.

Over our history, laws and policies enacted by the government led to the legitimization of much more than inequality – they legitimized hatred and violence, and brought shame to those targeted.

While we may view modern Canada as a forward-thinking, progressive nation, we can’t forget our past: The state orchestrated a culture of stigma and fear around LGBTQ2 communities. And in doing so, destroyed people’s lives.

Mr. Speaker, a Purge that lasted decades will forever remain a tragic act of discrimination suffered by Canadian citizens at the hands of their own government.

From the 1950s to the early 1990s, the Government of Canada exercised its authority in a cruel and unjust manner, undertaking a campaign of oppression against members, and suspected members, of the LGBTQ2 communities.

The goal was to identify these workers throughout the public service, including the foreign service, the military, and the RCMP, and persecute them.

You see, the thinking of the day was that all non-heterosexual Canadians would automatically be at an increased risk of blackmail by our adversaries due to what was called “character weakness”.

This thinking was prejudiced and flawed. And sadly, what resulted was nothing short of a witch-hunt.

The public service, the military, and the RCMP spied on their own people, inside and outside of the workplaces. Canadians were monitored for anything that could be construed as homosexual behaviour, with community groups, bars, parks, and even people’s homes constantly under watch.

During this time, the federal government even dedicated funding to an absurd device known as the Fruit Machine – a failed technology that was supposed to measure homosexual attraction. This project was funded with the intention of using it against Canadians.

When the government felt that enough evidence had accumulated, some suspects were taken to secret locations in the dark of night to be interrogated.

They were asked invasive questions about their relationships and sexual preferences. Hooked up to polygraph machines, these law-abiding public servants had the most intimate details of their lives cut open.

Women and men were abused by their superiors, and asked demeaning, probing questions about their sex lives. Some were sexually assaulted.

Those who admitted they were gay were fired, discharged, or intimidated into resignation. They lost dignity, lost careers, and had their dreams – and indeed, their lives – shattered.

Many were blackmailed to report their peers, forced to turn against their friends and colleagues.

Some swore they would end their relationships if they could keep their jobs. Pushed deeper into the closet, they lost partners, friends, and dignity.

Those who did not lose their jobs were demoted, had security clearances revoked, and were passed over for promotions.

Under the harsh glare of the spotlight, people were forced to make an impossible choice between career and identity.

The very thing Canadian officials feared – blackmail of LGBTQ2 employees – was happening. But it wasn’t at the hands of our adversaries; it was at the hands of our own government.

Mr. Speaker, the number one job of any government is to keep its citizens safe. And on this, we have failed LGBTQ2 people, time and time again.

It is with shame and sorrow and deep regret for the things we have done that I stand here today and say: We were wrong. We apologize. I am sorry. We are sorry.

For state-sponsored, systemic oppression and rejection, we are sorry.

For suppressing two-spirit Indigenous values and beliefs, we are sorry.

For abusing the power of the law, and making criminals of citizens, we are sorry.

For government censorship, and constant attempts to undermine your community-building;

For denying you equality, and forcing you to constantly fight for this equality, often at great cost;

For forcing you to live closeted lives, for rendering you invisible, and for making you feel ashamed –

We are deeply sorry. We were so very wrong.

To all the LGBTQ2 people across this country who we have harmed in countless ways, we are sorry.

To those who were left broken by a prejudiced system;

And to those who took their own lives – we failed you.

For stripping you of your dignity;

For robbing you of your potential;

For treating you like you were dangerous, indecent, and flawed;

We are sorry.

To the victims of The Purge, who were surveilled, interrogated, and abused;

Who were forced to turn on their friends and colleagues;

Who lost wages, lost health, and lost loved ones;

We betrayed you. And we are so sorry.

To those who were fired, to those who resigned, and to those who stayed at a great personal and professional cost;

To those who wanted to serve, but never got the chance to because of who you are – you should have been permitted to serve your country, and you were stripped of that option.

We are sorry. We were wrong.

Indeed, all Canadians missed out on the important contributions you could have made to our society.

You were not bad soldiers, sailors, airmen and women. You were not predators. And you were not criminals.

You served your country with integrity, and veterans you are.

You are professionals. You are patriots. And above all, you are innocent. And for all your suffering, you deserve justice, and you deserve peace.

It is our collective shame that you were so mistreated. And it is our collective shame that this apology took so long – many who suffered are no longer alive to hear these words. And for that, we are truly sorry.

To the loved ones of those who suffered;

To the partners, families, and friends of the people we harmed;

For upending your lives, and for causing you such irreparable pain and grief – we are sorry.

And as we apologize for our painful mistakes, we must also say thank you to those who spoke up.

To those who pushed back when it was unpopular, and even dangerous, to do so. People from across the country, from all walks of life, and of all political stripes. We stand here today in awe of your courage, and we thank you.

We also thank members of the We Demand an Apology Network, our LGBTQ2 Apology Advisory Council, the Just Society Committee for Egale, as well as the individuals who have long advocated for this overdue apology.

Through them, we’ve understood that we can’t simply paint over this part of our history. To erase this dark chapter would be a disservice to the community, and to all Canadians.

We will work with the academic community and stakeholders to ensure that this history is known and publically accessible.

We must remember, and we will remember. We will honour and memorialize the legacy of those who fought before us in the face of unbearable hatred and danger.

Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that we will look back on today as a turning point. But there is still much work to do.

Discrimination against LGBTQ2 communities is not a moment in time, but an ongoing, centuries-old campaign.

We want to be a partner and ally to LGBTQ2 Canadians in the years going forward. There are still real struggles facing these communities, including for those who are intersex, queer people of colour, and others who suffer from intersectional discrimination.

Transgender Canadians are subjected to discrimination, violence, and aggression at alarming rates. In fact, trans people didn’t even have explicit protection under federal human rights legislation until this year.

Mental health issues and suicides are higher among LGBTQ2 youth as a result of discrimination and harassment, and the homelessness rates among these young people is staggering.

And there is still work to do on blood and organ donation, and the over criminalization of HIV non-disclosure. The Government needs to continue working with our partners to improve policies and programs.

But there are important and significant changes coming – the repeal of section 159 of the Criminal Code is working its way through the House.

And, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that earlier today in this House we tabled the Expungement of Historically Unjust Convictions Act. This will mean that Canadians previously convicted of consensual sexual activity with same-sex partners will have their criminal records permanently destroyed.

Further, I am pleased to announce that over the course of the weekend, we reached an Agreement-in-Principle with those involved in the class action lawsuit for actions related to “The Purge”.

Never again will our government be the source of so much pain for members of the LGBTQ2 communities.

We promise to consult and work with individuals and communities to right these wrongs and begin to rebuild trust. We will ensure that there are systems in place so that these kinds of hateful practices are a thing of the past. Discrimination and oppression of LGBTQ2 Canadians will not be tolerated anymore.

With dialogue and with understanding, we will move forward together. But we can’t do it alone.

The changing of hearts and minds is a collective effort. We need to work together, across jurisdictions, with Indigenous peoples and LGBTQ2 communities, to make the crucial progress that LGBTQ2 Canadians deserve.

Mr. Speaker, Canada’s history is far from perfect.

But we believe in acknowledging and righting past wrongs so that we can learn from them.

For all our differences, for all our diversity, we can find love and support in our common humanity.

We’re Canadians, and we want the very best for each other, regardless of our sexual orientation, or our gender identity and expression. We will support one another in our fight for equality.

And Canada will stand tall on the international stage as we proudly advocate for equal rights for LGBTQ2 communities around the world.

To the kids who are listening at home and who fear rejection because of their sexual orientation or their gender identity and expression;

And to those who are nervous and scared, but also excited at what their future might hold;

We are all worthy of love, and deserving of respect.

And whether you discover your truth at 6 or 16 or 60, who you are is valid.

To members of the LGBTQ2 communities, young and old, here in Canada and around the world:

You are loved. And we support you.

Canada gets a little bit stronger every day that we choose to embrace, and to celebrate, who we are in all our uniqueness. We are a diverse nation, and we are enriched by the lives, experiences, and contributions of people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer, and two-spirit.

To the trailblazers who have lived and struggled, and to those who have fought so hard to get us to this place: thank you for your courage, and thank you for lending your voices. I hope you look back on all you have done with pride.

It is because of your courage that we’re here today, together, and reminding ourselves that we can, and must, do better.

For the oppression of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and two-spirit communities, we apologize. On behalf of the government, Parliament, and the people of Canada: We were wrong. We are sorry. And we will never let this happen again.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Good afternoon.

Mr. President, fellow delegates, friends.

Before I begin, I would like to offer Canada’s condolences, in the light of Tuesday’s earthquake in Mexico, to all families and friends in mourning.

We wish a speedy recovery for all those who have been injured, and thank all first responders for their tireless efforts to help keep people safe.

Our thoughts are also with our friends in the Caribbean who continue to suffer from devastating hurricanes.

The generosity and resilience that millions have shown in the face of these natural disasters is an inspiration to the world, and Canada stands ready to lend a helping hand in whatever way it can.

It is an honour to be back here with you today, and to have an opportunity to speak to this year’s theme: “Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet.”

People. Peace. A good quality of life, and caring for our environment.

Fairness for people no matter where they live.

These things that matter deeply to Canadians.

We have, throughout our history, worked hard to secure them.

At home and around the world.

I’d like to share with you today some of the difficult lessons that Canada has learned along the way.

Canada is not a wonderland, free of the challenges you face.

We face many of the same challenges that you do.

Canada remains a work in progress.

So I want to tell you about the Canadian experience because for all the mistakes we’ve made, we remain hopeful.

Hopeful that we can do better, and be better, and treat each other with the dignity and the respect that is the birthright of every human being.

I want to tell you our story because I know that the challenges we have faced – and continue to face – are not unique in the world.

And neither are the solutions.

An approach that values human dignity – that emphasizes fairness and real opportunity for everyone – has a home in Canada and in every country.

It’s an approach that doesn’t just serve domestic needs, but that makes the world a better, more peaceful, more prosperous place for all.

This year, in 2017, Canada celebrated the 150th anniversary of Confederation. Our 150th birthday, if you will.

But Canada is much older than that.

It has been home to the descendants of settlers and immigrants for hundreds of years, and Indigenous Peoples for millennia.

We are a country built on different cultures, different religions, different languages all coming together.

That diversity has become our great strength.

But that is not and has not always been true for everyone who shares our land.

Canada is built on the ancestral land of Indigenous Peoples – but regrettably, it’s also a country that came into being without the meaningful participation of those who were there first.

And even where treaties had been formed to provide a foundation for proper relations, they have not been fully honoured or implemented.

For First Nations, Metis Nation and Inuit peoples in Canada, those early colonial relationships were not about strength through diversity, or a celebration of our differences.

For Indigenous Peoples in Canada, the experience was mostly one of humiliation, neglect, and abuse.

Of a government that didn’t respect their traditions and strengths, or their distinct governments and laws, but instead denied and undermined their rights and their dignity.

That sought to overwrite their distinct histories, to eradicate their distinct languages and cultures, and to impose colonial traditions and ways of life.

That discarded the Indigenous imperative to protect the land and water, of always thinking seven generations ahead.

In doing so, we rejected the very notion that whole generations of Indigenous Peoples have the right to define for themselves what a decent life might be.

And we robbed Canada of the contributions these generations would have made to growing our great country.

The failure of successive Canadian governments to respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples in Canada is our great shame.

And for many Indigenous Peoples, this lack of respect for their rights persists to this day.

There are, today, children living on reserve in Canada who cannot safely drink, or bathe in, or even play in the water that comes out of their taps.

There are Indigenous parents who say goodnight to their children, and have to cross their fingers in the hopes that their kids won’t run away, or take their own lives in the night.

Young Indigenous people in Canada struggle to get a good education.

And though residential schools are thankfully a thing of the past, too many Indigenous youth are still sent away, far from their families, just to get the basic education most Canadians take for granted.

And for far too many Indigenous women, life in Canada includes threats of violence so frequent and severe that Amnesty International has called it “a human rights crisis.”

That is the legacy of colonialism in Canada.

Of a paternalistic Indian Act.

Of the forced relocation of Inuit and First Nations communities, and a systematic denial of Métis rights and history.

Of residential schools that separated children as young as five years old from their families, punished them for speaking their own language, and sought to extinguish Indigenous cultures entirely.

The good news is that Canadians get it. They see the inequities. They’re fed up with the excuses.

And that impatience gives us a rare and precious opportunity to act.

We now have before us an opportunity to deliver true, meaningful and lasting reconciliation between Canada and First Nations, the Métis Nation, and Inuit peoples.

And as we embark upon that process of reconciliation, we are guided by the minimum standards adopted here, in this chamber, ten years ago this month.

I know that Canada has a complicated history with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

We actively campaigned and voted against it, then endorsed it in the most half-hearted way possible, calling it an “aspirational document.”

The Declaration is not an aspirational document. It means much more than that to the Indigenous Peoples and others who worked so hard, for so long, to bring the Declaration to life.

In the words of Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the Declaration provides “the necessary principles, norms, and standards for reconciliation to flourish in twenty-first-century Canada.”

That’s not an aspiration. That’s a way forward.


Last year, at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, Canada’s then Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs finally corrected Canada’s position on the Declaration, and announced that we are now a full supporter of the Declaration, without qualification.

In partnership with Indigenous Peoples, we’re moving ahead with a thorough review of federal laws, policies, and operational practices, to get our house in order.

To make sure that our government is meeting its obligations, including international obligations under the Declaration.

We know that the world expects Canada to strictly adhere to international human rights standards – including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples – and that is what we expect of ourselves, too.

We are working closely with Indigenous Peoples in Canada to better respond to their priorities, to better understand how they see and define self-determination, and to support their work of nation rebuilding.

Along with Indigenous partners, we are co-developing programs to ensure the preservation, protection and revitalization of Métis, Inuit and First Nations languages.

In short, we have been working hard, in partnership with other orders of government, and with lndigenous leaders in Canada, to correct past injustices and bring about a better quality of life for Indigenous Peoples in Canada.

I’ll give you a few examples.

Many will sound familiar to you, because they are closely aligned with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals – goals that apply to all of our countries, without exception.

Our efforts include investments to help bring safe and clean drinking water to all Indigenous communities – part of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal #6: clean water and sanitation.

So far, more than two dozen long-term drinking water advisories in Indigenous communities have been eliminated, and we have a plan to bring to an end those that remain.

Our efforts also include new investments to close the gap in First Nations education, and new education agreements that recognize the power and authority of First Nations communities.

And these agreements recognize First Nations’ authority to develop and control education systems – systems run in communities, by communities, and for communities.

These are all important steps toward SDG #4: quality education.

Beyond that, for many Indigenous Peoples in Canada, these investments will lay the groundwork for progress on SDG #8: decent work and economic growth.

We know that no one can have a real and fair chance at success without the things that make success possible: good health; strong communities; good, well-paying jobs; a quality education, and safe and affordable places to live.

Clearly, that includes Indigenous Peoples, too.

That’s why our efforts include working with Indigenous communities to help build and refurbish homes.

Construction work on nearly 4,000 homes has been completed or is underway, helping to fulfill SDG #11: making communities safe and sustainable places to live.

And across the country, we are also working on a National Housing Strategy, to give more Canadians access to housing that is safe, adequate, and affordable.

Our efforts also include a stronger focus – in Indigenous communities, across Canada, and around the world – on SDG #5: combatting gender-based violence and giving women and girls equal opportunities to succeed.

We need women and girls to succeed because that’s how we grow stronger economies, and build stronger communities.

That is why our government will be moving forward shortly with legislation to ensure equal pay for work of equal value.

You see, the Sustainable Development Goals are as meaningful in Canada as they are everywhere else in the world, and we are committed to implementing them at home while we also work with our international partners to achieve them around the world.

This is important, because poverty and hunger know no borders. We cannot pretend that these solvable challenges happen only on distant shores.

The need for greater equality and decent work – those are real and persistent human needs. Ones we cannot afford to ignore, especially in our own countries.

We are challenged, every one of us, to provide better opportunities for all people, including Indigenous Peoples.

We are challenged by the fact that true equality is unconditional.

Equality applies to every person. No matter their gender, or where they were born, or how they worship, or whom they choose to love.

And the need to better care for the environment we all share … well, as I said here at the signing ceremony for the Paris Agreement, “in every possible sense, we are all in this together.”

We are all in this together, and the relationships we build need to reflect this reality.

In Canada, this means new relationships between the government of Canada and Indigenous Peoples – relationships based on recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership.

Recently, we made changes to our own government structures, to help with the transition to these new relationships with Indigenous Peoples.

We are dismantling the old colonial bureaucratic structures and creating a new Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs, led by Dr. Carolyn Bennett, an experienced and effective advocate for Indigenous Peoples in Canada.

In her new role, she will lead our government’s efforts to better support Indigenous Peoples as they strengthen their distinct political, cultural, legal and economic institutions, and assume autonomy over their own affairs, including the recognition and implementation of self-government as an expression of self-determination.

At the same time, we recognize that in Canada, the federal government has a historic responsibility for providing services to Indigenous Peoples, and an ongoing role to play.

To better do this work – while at the same time supporting Indigenous self-determination – we will create, in consultation with Indigenous Peoples, a new Department of Indigenous Services, led by our former Minister of Health, Dr. Jane Philpott.

Over time, programs and services will increasingly be delivered by Indigenous Peoples, as part of their move toward true self-government, and the full implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

We believe that this division is the best way for Canada to meet more of its SDG obligations at home, while advancing the principle of self-determination that is at the heart of the Declaration.

There is no blueprint for this kind of change.

There is no road map we can follow.

But neither can we wait.

The time has come to forge new paths together.

To move beyond the limitations of old and outdated colonial structures, and to create in their place something new, something that respects the inherent right of Indigenous Peoples to self-govern, and to determine their own future.

For the federal government, this means making changes to how we operate. The departmental change I mentioned is part of fulfilling that responsibility.

For Indigenous Peoples, it means taking a hard look at how they define and govern themselves as nations and governments, and how they seek to relate to other orders of government.

Indigenous Peoples will decide how they wish to represent and organize themselves.

Some may choose to engage with our government based on historic nations and treaties, others will use different shared experiences as the basis for coming together.

The choice is theirs. This is precisely what self-determination demands.

Though this path is uncharted, I am confident that we will reach a place of reconciliation.

That we will get to a place as a country where nation-to-nation, government-to-government, and Inuit-Crown relationships can be transformed.

A place where the standards enshrined in the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples are fully realized – not merely by government mandate, but in true partnership with Indigenous Peoples.

Part of that new partnership will involve addressing the shared challenge of climate change.

Indigenous and northern communities are particularly affected by its stark reality.

In communities across the north – places like Paulatuk, Kugluktuk, and Tuktoyaktuk – where community members are finding sea ice conditions more dangerous and unpredictable for travelling and hunting in the winter.

In Canada’s western Arctic, the permafrost is melting and huge pieces of tundra are eroding into the ocean.

And around Baffin Island, Inuit elders are finding it difficult to forecast the weather like they used to. So difficult that many are now reluctant even to try.

At home, we are working hard to help these communities adapt and prepare for the future.

At the international level, our commitment is unwavering.

There is no country on this planet that can walk away from the reality of climate change.

And for our part, Canada will continue to fight for the global plan that has a realistic chance of countering it.

We have a responsibility to future generations, and we will uphold it.

We have a chance to build in Canada – and in fact, all around the world – economies that are clean, that are growing, that are forward-looking. We will not let that opportunity pass us by.

In Canada, that means putting a price on carbon pollution. Done well, it’s the most effective way to reduce emissions while continuing to grow the economy.

It also means continuing to work with other countries in support of our shared goals.

Last week, we welcomed environmental leaders from more than 30 countries to a working session in Montréal, where we talked about how to advance the Paris Agreement and continue the global shift toward a more sustainable future for all people.

Likewise, the global community has a responsibility to do all that it can to reduce inequality within and among countries.

In Canada, we are working hard to achieve this goal.

We improved child benefit payments. Our new program gives nine out of ten families more money to help with the high cost of raising their kids, and because of that, we expect to reduce child poverty in Canada by 40%.

We raised taxes on the wealthiest one percent so that we could lower them for the middle class, and we’re continuing to look for ways to make our tax system more fair.

Right now we have a system that encourages wealthy Canadians to use private corporations to pay a lower tax rate than middle class Canadians.

That’s not fair, and we’re going to fix it.

We’re investing to help make education more affordable and more accessible, so that every Canadian can get the training they need to find and keep a good, well-paying job.

This is especially important at a time when automation is challenging traditional ideas of work.

Internationally, we have reaffirmed Canada’s commitment to reducing poverty and inequality, putting gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls at the heart of our development efforts.

We took this approach because we know that when we empower women and girls, economic growth follows.

Peace and cooperation takes root.

And a better quality of life for families and communities is possible.

We are also working hard to deliver progressive trade agreements like the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the European Union, which comes into effect today.

CETA will expand opportunities for businesses; create good, well-paying jobs for workers; and deliver meaningful economic growth – the kind of growth that benefits all our citizens, not just the wealthiest.

We have the opportunity – and I would argue we have the responsibility – to ensure that trade agreements include strong provisions to safeguard workers’ rights, to protect the environment, and to ensure that the benefits of trade are felt more broadly.

Because when we do that, we don’t just grow our economies – we live up to our values.

And we say to ourselves and to each other that good enough… just isn’t good enough. That better is always possible.

And better is always possible when we put people at the heart of the decisions we make.

A focus on people – as the theme for this General Debate reminds us – is the best way to build a peaceful and prosperous future.

It’s a future we all want – for ourselves, and our children, and our grandchildren.

It’s a future that Indigenous Peoples in Canada, and around the world, deserve to share in – as full and equal partners.

And it’s a future we can build, if we work together.

Our efforts to build a better relationship with Indigenous Peoples in Canada are not only about righting historical wrongs.

They are about listening, and learning, and working together. They are also about concrete action for the future.

The reconciliation we seek has lessons for us all.

We can’t build strong relationships if we refuse to have conversations.

We can’t chart a more peaceful path if the starting point is suspicion and mistrust.

And we can’t build a better world unless we work together, respect our differences, protect the vulnerable, and stand up for the things that matter most.

As I said last year, we know it will be hard work.

But I remain confident – for Canada’s experience shows this to be true – that any challenge can be met if we meet it together.

Thank you.

Thank you all for being here today.

Last week I had the honour of meeting with Her Majesty The Queen, in Scotland.

It was a particularly poignant visit, taking place as it did during both the 150th anniversary of Confederation, and the 65th year of Her Majesty’s service as Canada’s Head of State.

It was a meeting that gave us an opportunity to talk about our shared history and a chance to reflect on what the coming years might look like.

We know that later this year, the steady and trusted leadership of The Queen’s current representative in Canada, His Excellency the Right Honourable David Johnston, will come to an end.

After seven years of service marked by hard work, grace, and humility, His Excellency will be retiring this fall.

When his appointment was first announced back in 2010, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said that the Governor General “represents the best of Canada.”

That was true then, and it is true now.

We will always be grateful for the contributions the Governor General and Mrs. Johnston have made in service to our country, and we wish them all the best in the years ahead.

Which brings us to today’s announcement.

I am very pleased to announce that, on my recommendation, Her Majesty The Queen has graciously approved the appointment of Ms. Julie Payette as the next Governor General of Canada.

Already well known to Canadians, Ms. Payette has made her mark as an accomplished scientist, jet pilot, athlete, public policy scholar, musician, and science and technology advocate.

She is undoubtedly best known for her ground-breaking work as a leader in Canada’s space program.

Ms. Payette served as an astronaut with the Canadian Space Agency for more than a decade.

She was Canada’s Chief Astronaut from 2000 to 2007, and the second Canadian woman to enter space.

And, in 2009, she proudly represented all Canadians during our first visit to the International Space Station.

Many of you probably remember watching as Ms. Payette and seven other prominent Canadians carried the Olympic Flag during the opening ceremonies in Vancouver in 2010.

Ms. Payette’s life has been one dedicated to discovery, to dreaming big, and to always staying focused on the things that matter most.

These truly Canadian traits, along with her years of public service, make her unquestionably qualified for this high office.

I know she will be an excellent Governor General and I am looking forward to her installation ceremony this fall, when she will formally become Canada’s 29th Governor General since Confederation.

It is my privilege to now introduce Canada’s Governor General Designate: Ms. Julie Payette.

Hello everyone! Happy Canada Day!

What a crowd!

You know, I’m pretty confident that we’re breaking records here on Parliament Hill. And we should be, because today, together, we’recelebrating Canada 150!

I’d like to acknowledge that we are on the ancestral lands of the Algonquin people.

And I want to start with a thank you. To the hundreds of thousands here on the Hill and across our nation’s capital, thank you for being here.

And to the millions more, in your homes across the country, maybe watching through the screen door while trying not to burn the hot dog buns on the barbecue; or chilling with friends and neighbours in the local park, festooned in red and white, thank you for joining us, and for celebrating with us today.

And to our expat friends and family, gathered in far-off places like the Maple Leaf Pub in London or the Big Bite in Hong Kong, thanks for joining us, we love you and miss you right back! And I have no idea what time it is where you are, but cheers!

And of course, I’d also like to thank Their Royal Highnesses, The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall for being with us today to mark this tremendous celebration.

150 years since Confederation.

A nice, round number that’s as good a reason as any to celebrate. To throw a massive party and invite the friends and neighbours. To reflect on our past, to cheer on today, and to recommit ourselves to the future. But let’s not kid ourselves: this isn't really our 150th birthday.

We’re much older than that: Canada, and the idea of Canada, goes much further back than just 150 years. For thousands of years, in this place, people have met, traded, built, loved, lost, fought, grieved. They built strong communities, worked hard to build better lives for their kids, and learned to lean on their neighbours to get through our long cold winter nights, to thrive in the daunting landscapes that stretch across Turtle Island.

For centuries, families have chosen to build their lives in Canada, in many cases embarking on great journeys in search of a better future. And because of the support of those who were already here, it was possible to achieve individual success and build strong communities.

So of course, Canada is a lot older than 150 years. But, let’s be honest, Canada is young as well.

You see, many people will tell you that our nation was only truly born a hundred years ago, when for the first time Canadians of all backgrounds were joined, to fight and die and win together at a faraway place called Vimy Ridge.

The valour we defined that day would echo through names like Dieppe, Juno, Kandahar, and so many others.

But we took our place on the world stage, too, through constructive engagement: from the crisis in the Suez to the floor of the UN. By welcoming the world to come see who we are, as we figured out for ourselves with Expos 67 and 86. With Olympic Games in Montreal, in Calgary, in Vancouver.

But if we’re going to talk sports, maybe we became a nation with the Summit Series, in ’72, where ‘we all squeezed the stick and we all pulled the trigger.’

Or was it in ’65, when we chose our beloved Maple Leaf flag?

Maybe it didn't really happen until we brought home the Constitution, and defined ourselves through the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a mere 35 years ago.

So really, I guess 150 years is as good a date as any, because it lets us really celebrate all of that, and more, today.

In 1867, Confederation became a reality thanks to the compromise and vision of people like John A. Macdonald and George-Étienne Carter.

What began as a partnership between four provinces became something much greater; a country that is extraordinary, prosperous and generous. A land of possibility.

Canada has been blessed with leaders of all stripes who recognized how special this place is. Leaders who believed in the Canadian dream, who built railways and highways and seaways to connect us to each other, and to the world. These projects became the backbone of Canada; infrastructure worthy of a great nation.

But the story of Canada should not be confined to grand acts of nation building. The story of Canada is really the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things.

The valour of Francis Pegahmagabow. The courage of Viola Desmond. The leadership of Thérèse Casgrain. The tenacity of Terry Fox.

It’s in these people that the true story of Canada is told. Their triumphs are unique, but the values that underpin them are Canadian values.

William Lyon Mackenzie King once said that citizenship is public service “in one form or another”. He was right. Being a citizen of Canada goes hand in hand with serving Canada. With believing in something bigger than ourselves, and giving back of our time in support of it.

Because this country has given us so much to be grateful for.

Millions of people from around the world have chosen Canada as their home. Millions more were born into such luck.

Many of us grew up here. We made childhood friends here, we fell in love here, raised our kids here. My friends, the one of the greatest gifts we’ve ever been given is the gift of Canadian citizenship.

Louis St. Laurent referred to Canada as a place where people joined their talents without merging their identities. And it’s true.

Canada is a country made strong not in spite of our differences but because of them. We don’t aspire to be a melting pot – indeed, we know true strength and resilience flows through Canadian diversity.

Ours is a land of original peoples and of newcomers. And our greatest pride is that you can come here from anywhere in the world, build a good life, and be part of our community. We don’t care where you’re from or what religion you practice or whom you love. You are all welcome in Canada.

But let’s not forget that if Canada is a truly multicultural and open place today, it’s not by chance.

Indeed, the very unity of our country 150 years ago hinged on the acceptance of multiple languages and cultures.

It hinged on the peaceful coexistence – and active cooperation – between people who were different from one another.

Over time, the bilingual character of our country became a central and definitive part of our identity – and an official policy.

We speak French and English, with hundreds more languages spoken from coast to coast to coast.

And so, diversity has been at the very core of Canada for centuries. It’s the foundation on which our country was built.

We may be of every colour and creed, from every corner of the world...

We may live in British Columbia. Yukon. Alberta. The Northwest Territories. Saskatchewan. Manitoba. Nunavut. Ontario. Quebec. New Brunswick. Prince Edward Island. Nova Scotia. Or Newfoundland and Labrador.

But we embrace that diversity, while knowing in our hearts that we are all Canadians, and that we share a common pride in that red and white flag.

Yet, as we trace our history, we know that our record is far from perfect.

We know that, while many of us celebrate Canada 150, others do not.

Indigenous Peoples in this country have faced oppression for centuries – since early explorers believed they had found a new world.

As a society, we must acknowledge and apologize for past wrongs, and chart a path forward – one that promises a bright future for all Canadians.

We’ve got a long way to go to make things right with Indigenous Peoples in Canada. But we have begun that journey, together.

Canada 150 gives us reason to reflect, not only on our success, but also on our remaining challenges. And in doing so, we vow to set a new course for the next 150 years – one in which a nation-to-nation, Inuit-to-Crown, and government-to-government relationship with Indigenous Peoples is a top priority.

This is what we have to remember: We can achieve reconciliation. But in order to get there, we must educate ourselves, dedicate our efforts to progress, and work very, very hard to see it through, over the coming years and decades.

It is a choice we make, not because of what we did, or were, but because of who we are.

Let us be known the world over for our integrity, for our compassion, and for our never-ending desire to be better, so we can do better.

That’s the Canadian way.

Whether it was building a railway through the Rockies or a quantum computer, Canadians know that better is always possible.

As we know, the success of Canada did not happen by accident, and it won’t continue without effort.

Our job now is to advance equal opportunity to ensure that each and every Canadian has a real and fair chance at success.

We must create the right conditions so that the middle class, and those working hard to join it, can build a good life for themselves and their families.

And we have to work together to combat climate change, one of the greatest crises facing our planet. It’s up to us to leave our kids and grandkids with a better future – through a present in which protecting our environment is an obligation, not an option.

And we can do it. I know we can.

My friends, many of you have come here from great distances.

So take a second. Look around. And really take in this moment. You are all a part of history.

150 years? Nah. Look at us: Canada is being born today.

And thanks to all of you, will be again tomorrow.

You know, when we set out into the world, many of us do so with a maple leaf sewn onto our backpacks. But all of us already have that maple leaf graven onto our souls. It’s a subtle, quiet pride in knowing that we are blessed to be citizens of Canada, the best country on Earth.

So be proud of our accomplishments.

Be proud of our country.

For this is Canada.

And this is home.

Consider:

The price they paid.

The burden they bore.

The country they made.  

Seven thousand and four Canadians were wounded in the battle that began here, 100 years ago today. Three thousand, five hundred and ninety-eight Canadians died.

This, from a population, in 1917, of just eight million.

Think of it, for a moment. The enormity of the price they paid.

These were, for the most part, young men in their late teens and early twenties. Not professional soldiers. But they were superbly trained. And supported by months of painstaking preparation.   

Yet for all that, they still required courage – to a degree that is hard to fathom.  

They weren’t impervious to fear, these men. They were human. Homesick, tired, footsore and cold.  

Yet still, they advanced. Uphill, through mud. Under fire. They advanced, fighting like lions, moving just behind a devastating allied artillery barrage.

And they did not stop. They did not stop, until they had victory.

There were strategic objectives. Vimy is high ground. It had been transformed into a fortress.

But if you read the accounts of the men who fought here, you’ll find they focused on other things.  

They wrote to loved ones. They thanked them for parcels and letters. They asked about brothers and sisters. And they wrote about their fellow soldiers – those who’d fallen. Those still fighting.

Typical Canadians, they talked about the weather.

“The sun has been shining a couple times this last week,” reads a letter from William Henry Bell, dated April 7th, 1917. “The sun is a kind of stranger here. Say, that cake you sent was sure fine.”

William Bell died at Vimy, April 10th, 1917. He was twenty.

The burden, they bore.  

And, the country they made.

Because this, too, is why we’re here. Why we remember.

For in their ultimate sacrifice, these ordinary, yet extraordinary, men of the British dominion fought for the first time as the people of one country. Francophone, Anglophone. New Canadians. Indigenous Peoples. Side by side, united here at Vimy in the four divisions of the Canadian Corps.  

It is by their sacrifice that Canada became an independent signatory to the Treaty of Versailles.

In that sense, Canada was born here.

The sculpture of Canada Bereft is an emblem of a nation’s grief. It’s an emblem of loving care – which evokes also the thousands of Canadian women who bravely answered the call, serving as nurses, or who provided critical support at home.

But this monument is also symbolic of Canada’s birth – and our enduring commitment to peace. As I see the faces gathered here – veterans, caregivers, so many young people – I can’t help but feel a torch is being passed. One hundred years later, we must say this, together. And we must believe it: Never again.

Friends and honoured guests, let us hold to the grace of William Henry Bell. To the grace of the ones who stood by their friends, through unimaginable hardship. Through death itself.

And who, in that offering, stood by their country. And made their country, in its beginnings.

They were Canadians. They were valiant, beyond measure.

Honour them. 

Good evening.

Thank you Dan, for the kind introduction. And thank you all for being here. To the many policy makers and industry leaders here today, thank you.

And, of course, to the organizers of CERAWeek – thank you so much for this award. It truly is an honour – for me personally, for Canada’s superb natural resources minister, Jim Carr, who is here today, and for the government of Canada.

I’d like to begin with a little family history, if I may.

You may have heard that my father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, was also Prime Minister of Canada, back in the seventies and early eighties. In 1980, I was in my prime Star Wars years. Nine or so. Politics was not the first thing on my mind.

But that year, my dad’s government introduced a policy called the NEP. The National Energy Program. It lasted until 1985. And it didn’t work. It was a failure. It didn’t mean to be. But it ended up being the wrong policy at the wrong time.

Now, I’m not being disloyal when I say this. It’s just a historical fact. The NEP introduced a level of state control over energy that hurt growth and jobs. It became hugely controversial.

Consequently, when I began my run for leadership in 2012, 30 years later, the Trudeau name was mud in Alberta, still. A Trudeau, it was said, could not get elected dog catcher in Alberta.

But here’s the thing. I understood – we understood – that there is no path to prosperity in Canada that does not include a thriving, vibrant energy sector – both traditional, and renewable. We understood that our resource industries provide thousands of well-paying, middle-class jobs – not just in Alberta, but across Canada and around the world. And, by the way, here in Texas, too.

The Enbridge-Spectra merger, which creates one of the largest energy infrastructure companies on this continent, is only the most recent example of an extraordinarily productive partnership. Last year alone, Texas trade with Canada was worth $35.1-billion US dollars. Texas exports to Canada were worth nearly $20-billion US dollars. Imports from Canada, $15-billion US dollars. That translates into thousands of good, Texan jobs, my friends. By our reckoning, about 460,000. Not bad.  

The ties between our two countries are economic – and also strategic. This is the most successful economic relationship in the world, supporting millions of middle class jobs on both sides of the border. Canada buys more from America than does any other country. We are the number one customer of two thirds of U.S. states – and in the top three for 48 states.  

Nothing is more essential to the U .S. economy than access to a secure, reliable source of energy. Canada is that source. We have the third largest oil reserves in the world, and provide more than 40 per cent of America’s imported crude. And this extends beyond oil: we supply you with more electricity and uranium than any other country, too.

My point is just this: Canadians, cold-weather dwellers that we are, “get” the importance of energy. So, immediately upon launching my leadership campaign, I went to Calgary. I think quite a few people, including quite a few in my own party, thought I was crazy.

But, guess what?  A little over four years later, with a handful of Trudeau Liberals elected across Alberta, we’re on our way  to getting three new pipeline projects under way, which will help connect Canada’s oil patch with energy markets around the world.

The first, Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain line, will run from Alberta, across the Rockies to the Pacific. The second, TransCanada’s Keystone XL pipeline, recently approved by President Trump, will ship Canadian crude to refineries here in Texas. And there’s Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement, that also goes south. These ambitious projects will go a long way towards ensuring North American energy security – for years to come.

I make no bones about it: we’re proud of this. It’s progress. It’s important. As I said on that first trip to the oil patch back in 2012: no country would find 173 billion barrels of oil and just leave it in the ground. The resource will be developed. Our job is to ensure this is done responsibly, safely and sustainably.

Which brings me to the second piece, equally critical: while developing our resources, for the economic benefit of Canadians, we must also look to the future.

There will come a day, far off but inevitable at some point, when traditional energy sources will no longer be needed. In preparing for that day, we have two critical responsibilities. One is to sustain the planet between now and then, so that we can pass this treasure on to our children – better than we found it. The second is to get ahead of the curve on innovation.

And we in Canada are doing that. Canadian companies are leaders in developing technologies such as carbon capture, next-generation biofuels, advanced batteries for electric cars and cleaner oil-sands extraction processes, among other advances. This creates good jobs. It also helps the planet.

Here’s the crux of it: in Canada, as I said, we know all about preparing for winter and the long, cold nights. When we go camping – and we love to camp, that’s one stereotype that is totally accurate, by the way – we light our campfires before the sun goes down. That doesn’t make us anti-daylight.

It’s a bit the same with energy. Innovating – and pursuing renewables – isn’t somehow in competition with more traditional resources. It’s common sense. It’s wise preparation for the future. Our children and their children deserve no less.

All of which brings me full circle: we would not be on this path – not even close – had we not insisted that environmental protection and resource development go hand in hand. 

In the 21st Century, Canadians will not accept that we have to choose between a healthy planet and a strong economy. People want both. And they can have both. It takes compromise. It takes hard work. But it is possible.

The proof is that, a bit more than a year into our first (hopefully not our last) term of government, we have made progress on pipelines, as I mentioned, but also on a national carbon-reduction plan – which finally puts a price on carbon pollution. This was hammered out in cooperation with our provinces, equivalent to American states. It is a first step and more work needs to be done. But it is a first for our country, after years of false starts.

We could not have moved on pipelines had we not acted on climate. We could not have acted on climate had we not paid due deference to jobs, which is another way of saying, to the needs of the Canadian people – especially the middle class, and those working hard to join it.

And so this is why, my friends, I am so very pleased and honoured to receive this award. We are showing that environmental leadership and economic growth are inseparable. They are one. We are proud of the start we’ve made. And we hope it will become a model elsewhere.

Thank you.

Good evening, everyone. Thank you all for the warm welcome.

It is an honour to be here.  It’s truly a privilege just to be invited to the St. Matthew’s Day Banquet, and an even greater privilege to be one of your keynotes this evening.

I’d like to start by thanking Mayor Scholz for his gracious invitation. And to speak after Foreign Minister Gabriel is no small feat, but I’ll do my modest, Canadian best.

You know, whenmy office received the mayor’s invitation to this historic dinner, there was no question that I would attend.

Of course, this banquet’s repution precedes itself, as much for the great meal as for the mangnificent room. And I knew I had to be here because of the friendship between our two countries.

We have long been partners on the world stage.

Canadians and Germans value democracy and the rule of law. We understand the importance of international cooperation and partnership. And we share a progressive vision of the world, realizing the immense potential that comes with embracing change.

I talk a lot about how our goal as a government is to help the middle class and those working hard to join it. That, ultimately, was the vision for change that elected us. Regular Canadians were worried about their future, and we made a promise to support them through these uncertain times.

But that worry – that anxiety – isn’t unique to Canada. It’s everywhere.

Too many people around the world are anxious about what the future may hold.

And who could blame them?

With the pace of globalization and technological change, there is a very real fear out there that our kids will be worse off than we are. That they won’t have the same kind of opportunities that we have, despite being generally much more educated, and infinitely more tech-savvy.

Citizens across the political spectrum are looking for guidance. They’re looking for leadership. They’re looking for a voice.

And so far, they’re feeling a little let down.

When companies post record profits on the backs of workers consistently refused full-time work – and the job security that comes with it – people get defeated.

And when governments serve special interests  instead of the citizens interests who elected them – people lose faith.

Increasing inequality has made citizens distrust their governments. Distrust their employers.

It turns into “Us” vs. “Them”.

And we’re watching that anxiety transform into anger on an almost daily basis.

It follows that people’s natural defence mechanism is to hunker down and recoil inward. To give into cynicism. To retreat from one another.

But it’s time for us, as leaders in politics and business, to step up. It’s time to get real about the challenges facing the middle class, and those working hard to join it. Whether your goal is to build a successful company, or lead a respected and effective government, it’s time to realize that the old approaches don’t work anymore.

We can’t go about things the same way and expect to succeed in this new world.

People are looking for leadership. It’s up to each of us to determine what kind of leadership they find.

People don’t need leaders to tell them they have problems.

People need leaders to help them build solutions together.

I want to use this speech to challenge us. To highlight that the challenges we’re facing require real action and real leadership. And I’m choosing to do it here in Germany because I know you get that. On values, on approach, on inclusive success you’re on the right track and inspiring others to follow.

But we all need to do more.

For business leaders, it’s about thinking beyond your short term responsibility to your shareholders. You have an equally important responsibility to your workers, their families, and the communities that support you.

It’s time to pay a living wage. To pay your taxes. And give your workers the benefits – and peace of mind – that come with stable, full-time contracts.

You can’t build loyalty into corporate culture when people feel overworked and undervalued. You must give your workers avenues to update and modernize their skills for a changing world.

You must be part of the communities where you operate, realizing that these towns and cities support you, and you must, in turn, support them.

And when you hear that an employee is expecting a child, congratulate her, don’t make her question whether or not she’ll have a job to come back to.

And you must ensure your workplace, and especially your boardrooms, reflect the full diversity of society.

It’s time to take a broader view of employee-employer relationships. One that treats workers as partners in success.

Now, I fully appreciate the irony of preaching about the struggles of the middle class to a sea of tuxedoes and ball gowns, while wearing a bow-tie myself.

But this discussion needs to happen. We need to realize our collective responsibility – to the people who elected us. To the people who put their faith and trust in us.

The answers are not in this room. They’re out there. We all need to leave this place, and truly listen to people who are anxious about their futures.

Hear first-hand about their concerns, work with them to develop solutions, and actually implement them.

The hard work of change begins with each and every one of us – around our boardrooms, our water coolers, and our Parliaments.

As for Parliaments, let me tell you a little bit about what we’ve done in ours, in Canada.

We know that we are far from perfect, but what success we’ve had didn’t happen by accident and won’t continue without effort. So what I’ve done over the past years is listen to people talk about their worries. About the fact that the rising tide no longer seems to lift all boats.

In Canada, we’ve taken some steps to help allay that anxiety. To help people deal with the uncertainty of a changing world.

For example, we raised taxes on the wealthiest one per cent, so we could cut taxes for the middle class.

We improved child benefit payments into one single, monthly, tax free Canada Child Benefit. This initiative has given 9 out of 10 families more money to help with the high costs of raising their kids. Because of that, we’re on track to reduce child poverty by around 40 per cent in our country.

We’re increasing the amount of assistance Canadian students can get, helping to make post-secondary education more affordable.

And we’re investing in a range of training and employment programs for unemployed and underemployed Canadian workers, allowing them to upgrade their skills so they’re ready for the modern workforce.

These are just a handful of the things we’ve done to help people adapt to and absorb the changes we’re all feeling.

We could not have done this without listening to Canadians.

In fact, I’ve spent the last month and a half back at home on a cross-Canada tour. Over the past few weeks, I’ve done about a dozen town halls, filling arenas and community centres, and took questions for hours. On anything and everything. Nothing scripted, nothing staged. Just heard directly from middle class Canadians about the things they were worried about. And, more importantly, I heard what they needed from my government to help.

Now, for the politicians in the room, it probably sounds like a high risk proposition to answer a host of questions for hours on end. It was unpredictable and, at times, very intense. But it’s only in having those tough conversations that we can get at the heart of what matters.

To everyone here, I leave you with this. Better is always possible. But we have to make better happen.

We’re not going to get it right everyday.

But Canadians and Germans need to continue to lead by example.

Whether you’re a business or a government, it’s time to realize that this anger and anxiety we see washing over the world is coming from a very real place. And it’s not going away.

We can no longer brush aside the concerns of our workers and our citizens. We have to address the root cause of their worries, and get real about how the changing economy is impacting peoples’ lives.

Ladies and gentlemen, we can all play a role in making the transition to the new economy a smooth one. And it starts with listening.

Let’s be better, because we know we can do better.

For our citizens, for our workers, and for the entire world.

Thank you.

Introduction

President Tusk, President Tajani, distinguished Parliamentarians, ladies and gentlemen.

Good morning. It is a privilege to be here today. I’m told that this marks the first address to the EU Parliament by a sitting Canadian Prime Minister, so thank you for allowing me this honour.

As you know, I was in Brussels not too long ago to formally sign the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, and the Strategic Partnership Agreement.

Alongside President Tusk, President Juncker, and Prime Minister Fico, we took an important step towards deepening our relationship and expanding free and progressive trade between Canada and the European Union.

And yesterday, we took another huge step.

One that was decades in the making.

Canada-EU relationship and shared values

This year, we celebrate 41 years since the diplomatic mission of the European Commission was established in Ottawa.

And over the course of our historic partnership, Canada and the EU have stood side-by-side on the things that matter.

Things like maintaining global security.

Advancing the values of peace and justice.

And ensuring our peoples’ prosperity through trade and investment.

We’ve worked together on issues like climate change, and the rights of women and girls around the world.

And, ladies and gentlemen, I am confident that we will achieve tremendous things together in the years to come – for the countries we represent, and, most importantly, for the people we serve.

The European Union is a truly remarkable achievement, and an unprecedented model for peaceful cooperation. Canada knows that an effective European voice on the global stage isn’t just preferable – it’s essential.

We know that the EU is the world’s largest donor of development and humanitarian assistance, and that, together, your member states represent one of the world’s largest economies. Not only that, but you are a vital, central player in addressing the challenges that we collectively face as an international community. 

Indeed, the whole world benefits from a strong EU.

On behalf of Canadians, thank you for your continued, respectful engagement with our country. Indeed, the Canada-EU relationship has become an exemplary demonstration of international collaboration.

I’d like to thank Canada’s current Ambassador to the EU, Dan Costello, for his excellent service to our country. Dan has been tremendous in his ongoing support to our new Ambassador, the Honourable Stéphane Dion.

Stéphane, a close friend and mentor, is a man who has long fought to create a better country for all Canadians. He will proudly represent Canada with courage and conviction in this next important chapter.

Now, let me re-iterate what a tremendous honour it is for me to represent Canada in this historic chamber today. Coming to Strasbourg, and addressing you, was an important priority for me because I understand and appreciate the nature of what we have here.

I believe that the relationship between Canada and the EU is so resilient because it is centered on an important bedrock of common values. Values that shape and define us. Values that Canadians and Europeans share.

You see, collectively, we believe in democracy, transparency, and the rule of law. We believe in the recognition and respect of human rights. And we believe in inclusion, and embracing diversity.

We know that, in an increasingly connected world, we must choose to lead the international economy, not simply be subjected to its whims.

And we know that the state has an important role to play – not only in supporting its people, but also in helping to create the right conditions for progress.

And to this last point, as we have just demonstrated to the world, we, collectively, value trade, and the promise of prosperity for all our citizens that comes with it.

CETA

Yesterday – in addition to ratifying the Strategic Partnership Agreement – this Parliament voted to ratify the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.

After years of negotiations, this important trade agreement is finally crossing the finish line. And I think we can all agree – CETA was an enormously ambitious undertaking, and will prove to be one of our greatest successes.

I’d like to express my deepest gratitude to Canada’s former Minister of International Trade – now Minister of Foreign Affairs – Chrystia Freeland; our Chief Negotiator, Steve Verheul; and their EU counterparts for their tireless efforts in getting this deal done.

And I’m confident that our new Minister of International Trade, François-Philippe Champagne, will be a strong voice for Canada on the world stage over the coming years.

Now, let’s be clear – a deal as ambitious as CETA takes a lot of hard work. Every one of us in this room knows that this wasn’t easy. It took a lot of back of forth. It took extended discussions and negotiations. Meetings in Canada, and meetings across Europe.

But the finished product is something we can all be incredibly proud of. I believe that CETA will become the blueprint for future trade deals of this magnitude and complexity.

And that’s pretty amazing.

The motto of the European Union, “United in Diversity”, is a great reminder of what can be accomplished when, despite our differences, countries come together for the mutual benefit of our people.

Now, we live in a time when some people are worried that the current system only benefits society’s narrow elite. And their concern is valid.

This anxiety towards the economy and trade – the worry that our kids won’t have access to the same jobs and opportunities that we have – can be addressed only if we ensure that trade is inclusive, and that everyone benefits. 

And this agreement – the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement – is a terrific example of just that.

Because, at its heart, CETA is a framework for trade that works for everyone.

This agreement will result in the creation of good, well-paying jobs for middle class workers. It will put food on the table for families, and help grow and strengthen our communities.

Now, let’s say you’re a budding entrepreneur with an innovative product or idea. Maybe you’re having a tough time getting access to new customers. Well, CETA has just opened the door to new markets.

And what if you’re a consumer looking to buy imported goods, but the cross-border costs are too high? Maybe you’ve had your eye on Manitobah Mukluks, a Canadian, Indigenous-founded company whose products are currently subject to a 17 percent tariff in Europe. Well, with the ratification of CETA, those tariffs are removed, and you, as a consumer, are paying less at the check out.

Trade that is free and fair means less hold up and less red tape at our borders for international transactions.

It means that manufacturers can expand their products’ global reach, gaining market share and really competing with the best in the world.

And it means that folks working in service sectors like engineering, architecture, and information technology will see greater predictability and transparency when dealing with international clients.

At the end of the day, both Canada and the EU want to do what is best for our people.

We want hardworking folks to make a good living and support their families. We want moms and dads to be able to give their kids the opportunities that they never had. We want each generation of Canadians and Europeans to be better off, and have a higher standard of living, than the one that preceded it.

And deals like CETA – which is centered on the idea of trade that is both free and fair – will get us there.

At the end of the day, by making it easier to buy and sell products, we can expand opportunities for our businesses – both back in Canada and right across the EU. We can create jobs for the middle class, and make sure that the benefits of trade reach our citizens.

Make no mistake: This isn’t just about trade, in terms of imports and exports, dollars-in and dollars-out. It’s about making people’s lives better. CETA is a comprehensive blueprint for responsible economic cooperation between countries.

This modern, forward-looking agreement reflects a truly progressive trade agenda – one that protects the ability of societies to promote the public good. For example, within CETA there are provisions for labour protection.

For responsible investment practices.

For food and consumer safety.

For forest, fishery, and aquaculture management.

And for strong environmental stewardship.

My friends, this really is one of the most sustainable, progressive trade agreements in the world. And with it, Canada and the European Union have made history.

To all members present – thank you for your hard work over the last several years in making this ambitious goal a reality. I know that all our citizens will be better served for it.

Conclusion

Canada and the European Union have been friends, partners, and allies for a very long time. And our natural, easy relationship is grounded in what we have in common.

We share goals and aspirations for a better, safer, and fairer world.

We want to do right by the workers and families we were elected to represent.

And we embrace change, seeking the opportunity to lead in a global economy that’s constantly evolving.

CETA and the SPA – these landmark agreements – are a direct reflection of those commonalities. And it will serve to benefit Canadians and Europeans alike for generations to come.

In the things we have so far agreed upon, and in the discussions that lie ahead, the Canada-EU strategic partnership will forever be rooted in respect, and with an eye to the future.

My friends and dear colleagues, it’s safe to say that this is just the beginning. For Canada and the European Union, the best is yet to come.

Thank you very much.

Mr. Speaker –

It was with shock and sadness that Canadians heard about a despicable act of terror last night in Quebec City.

By current counts, six people worshipping at the Quebec City Islamic Cultural Centre have lost their lives, with many others seriously injured.

This was a group of innocents targeted for practicing their faith. Make no mistake – this was a terrorist attack.

It was an attack on our most intrinsic and cherished values as Canadians – values of openness, diversity, and freedom of religion.

Our hearts go out to the families of the victims. These people were just that – people. Ordinary Canadians. They were brothers, uncles, fathers, and friends. These were people of faith, and of community.

And in the blink of an eye, they were robbed of their lives in an act of brutal violence.

I know that, already, there’s a deeply personal connection here, in this very House. The Member of Parliament for Louis-Hebert knew this community and has joined them at the Centre many times. He is with them now as we speak today.

And to each of my 337 colleagues in this House, Mr. Speaker, remember that we are all leaders in our communities. At times like these, our communities need our leadership. It is in these moments that we must show ourselves worthy of the honour of sitting in this place.

Reach out to your friends and neighbours. Gather your communities. Be there for your people. They need you.  

To the injured, to the family members of these innocent victims, to the people of Quebec, and to all Canadians—

Know that we will get to the bottom of this. Such senseless violence has no place in Canadian society.

I’d like to express my deepest gratitude to the first responders, and thank local law enforcement officials, local government officials, and the Government of Quebec. I can assure Canadians that we will be working closely together in the days ahead.

I’d also like to thank the many political and faith leaders from around the world who have reached out since last night’s events. Your thoughts and condolences are greatly appreciated.

Canada has long been a diverse and accepting nation. We are kind. We are generous. And we embrace one another, not in spite of our differences, but because of them.

It is in tragic moments like this that we must come together in order to move forward. Canadians will not be broken by this violence. Our sense of spirit, and our sense of unity, will only strengthen.

The people who commit these acts mean to test our resolve, and weaken our values. They aim to divide us. To sow discord and plant hatred.

We will not close our minds. We will open our hearts.

Mr. Speaker, my friends, my fellow Canadians: let us strive to be the best version of ourselves in this dark hour.

To the more than one million Canadians who profess the Muslim faith, I want to say directly:

We are with you. 36 million Canadian hearts are breaking with yours.

And know that we value you. You enrich our shared country in immeasurable ways. It is your home.

Last night’s horrible crime against the Muslim community was an act of terror committed against Canada, and against all Canadians.

We will grieve with you. We will defend you. We will love you. And we will stand with you.

Over the coming days, take solace in one another. We will mourn this devastating attack, and we will heal, together. As one community, as one country, and as one family.

Canadians will not be intimidated. We will not meet violence with more violence.

We will meet fear and hatred with love and compassion.

Always.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Good afternoon.

Thank you for your kind welcome.

Before I begin, I’d like to recognize the Algonquin Nation, on whose traditional territory we are gathering.  We acknowledge them as the past, present and future caretakers of this land.

Elders, youth, veterans, National Chief Bellegarde, members of the AFN executive and Chiefs-in-Assembly: thank you for giving me the chance to be here with you today.        

It was back in January of 2013 that I watched – with deep respect and admiration – a group of young Cree leave their remote and northern Quebec community of Whapmagoostui and begin a 1600-kilometre trek through frigid weather.

Like so many Canadians, I watched them make their way by snowshoe, and then by foot, during that two-month journey to Ottawa.

Along the way, their numbers had grown from seven to over 400 on that morning in March when they walked into this town to the sound of traditional drums. We all know the Journey of the Nishiyuu: the Journey of the People.

I was one of many to meet them upon their arrival.  The “Original Seven”: David, Stanley, Travis, Johnny, Raymond, Geordie, and Isaac.

The tenacity, the determination and boldness of spirit that fuelled these youth inspired a nation, and brought the concerns of their community to the forefront.

Today, we gather in the capital of this nation, as many nations. 

We gather here in this moment to reflect on the first year of the journey to build a new relationship, one based on recognition and respect.

The Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Peoples of Canada have begun our own new walk together.  And together we’ve taken the first steps in what we all know is going to be a multi-generational journey.

In this spirit, no one here fools him- or herself that the path our country overwhelmingly agreed to take will always be a gentle one, or an easy one. We’ve already felt some headwinds. And there will be more.

I do not take my call for a nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous Peoples lightly.

I wake up every morning encouraged that we are finally doing this together, and each morning I wake up in anticipation of what new places we’ll find together.

And each morning I wake up with fresh resolve that we will keep pushing forward, like the Nishiyuu Walkers, until we reach our destination.

But unlike the Nishiyuu Walkers, who were happy to return home to their community and to the love of their families, we know that the past we are leaving behind us is not a good or happy place.

For all of us gathered here who are on our trek together, there is no giving up and turning around and heading back to the place where we all just last year so strongly agreed to move away from.

Not only can’t we go back there again: none of us wants to.

Jody Wilson-Raybould is Canada’s first Indigenous Minister of Justice and Attorney General.  

Not only is she the right person – Indigenous or otherwise – for this central role, she is our government’s loud and clear message to our country that the laws of this land that were, and in many ways still are, used to control and constrain Indigenous Peoples are now the particular responsibility of a First Nations person.  An Indigenous woman.

She, along with her Cabinet colleagues, will now lead a joint effort with Indigenous Peoples, aimed at de-colonializing Canada’s laws and policies that for so long have held back, rather than recognized, Indigenous rights.

My government supports the 94 calls to action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The work the Commission has done is some of the most important work ever in this country.  Each of the 94 needs to be implemented.

Indeed, as the one-year anniversary approaches, I am pleased to confirm that progress is underway on 36 of the 45 calls to action that are under solely federal purview.

We all know that addressing them thoroughly and with due diligence will take time.  I understand that many of you in this room are impatient. I know many of the people you serve are impatient. I am impatient too. But I’m encouraged by the meaningful progress we’ve already made. 

In May, Minister Bennett went to the UN to make clear our government’s unqualified support for the United Nations Declaration for the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  We remain committed to its adoption and implementation in full partnership and in consultation with Indigenous Peoples.

I have asked Minister Wilson-Raybould to lead the work collectively with her Cabinet colleagues and First Nations, the Métis Nation and Inuit Peoples to ensure that this gets done.

Since forming government, we have lifted 14 long-term drinking water advisories in First Nations communities, and we’re on track to have nearly half of remaining advisories eliminated within three years. We will lift all drinking water advisories in First Nations communities within our original five-year deadline.

As a teacher, I’m especially excited that this year, almost 2000 students started the school year in six brand-new schools. There are now 31 new schools under construction on reserve. Another 27 are being designed, and a further 72 are in feasibility studies.

I’m also excited that later this month, Canada’s first First Nations School Board Agreement in Manitoba is expected to be signed.  I know there are active discussions in other provinces to do the same.  

And as we all know, a federal government-mandated independent inquiry has been launched into the national horror and continuing trauma of Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls. And let me tell you one thing: to put it bluntly, this issue has always been and will always be on my radar.

We need to do more. But we have thousands of kids in new schools, we have 14 communities with clean water that didn’t have it before and have begun to get justice for sisters and daughters across the country. All in our first year.

Canadians now understand that, as Senator Murray Sinclair stated, reconciliation in this country isn’t just an Indigenous issue and problem – it is a Canadian issue and problem that we all need to address in real and concrete ways.

My government and the Assembly of First Nations have worked together to make early progress – not only against an important list of recommendations, but also in a new spirit of cooperation that will bring us closer to the goal of true reconciliation.

We must together show Canadians that we are working in unison to correct the historical wrongs and continuing intergenerational trauma that affects so many Indigenous Peoples.

You don’t need me to tell you how much more work still needs to be done.  It is a lived experience for many of you.  And our government remains committed to making meaningful and timely progress on the issues that matter most to you and your communities.

That includes working hard to close the persistent gaps that exist between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Peoples when it comes to employment opportunities, income, and housing.

It includes building the infrastructure your communities need to be safe, healthy places to live.

It includes doing more to address the unique needs of Indigenous children and youth, whose desperation is matched by a desire to succeed – something that is, sadly, too often ignored until it is too late.

We know all too well how residential schools and other decisions by governments were used as a deliberate tool to eliminate Indigenous languages and cultures. If we are to truly advance reconciliation, we must undo the lasting damage that resulted.

So today, I commit to you that our government will enact an Indigenous Languages Act, co-developed with Indigenous Peoples, with the goal of ensuring the preservation, protection, and revitalization of First Nations, Métis, and Inuit languages in this country.

All of us gathered in this room today must never allow Canadians, including Indigenous Peoples, to think or believe that reconciliation can’t or won’t work.

It is of the greatest imperative that all of us here never allow Canadians the chance to fear that due to a lack of joint leadership, of a true nation-to-nation dialogue and relationship, we aren’t able to achieve this most vital of goals.

Yes, we have a long way to go, but let’s not forget that we’ve also come a long way already. We must show Canada that we are partners.

This past summer, The Tragically Hip showed a whole nation how we can come together in a powerful and positive way. I heard Gord Downie that night in Kingston. And with your honouring him today, I know you heard him, too.

Indeed, 12 million Canadians heard him that night. Gord, in simple and elegant words, used that moment to advocate and advance by many years the reconciliation dialogue in our country.

Gord embodies all Canadians’ desire for reconciliation.

Just as your honouring him today is an act of reconciliation. The same way the young Cree Nishiyuu walker, David Kawapit, summoned his friends to take a leap of faith with him in a long walk of reconciliation, it is these individual acts that will help get our country where it needs and deserves to be.

I recently heard my friend Joseph Boyden speak to reconciliation and why it is so necessary.

He asked Canadians to understand the damage residential schools caused to Indigenous Peoples by comparing it to a great tsunami in slow motion advancing over the course of 140 years, destroying homes, splintering families, drowning children.

This tsunami in slow motion left no home untouched. But the tsunami has reached its high water mark and it now recedes.

And the artists are the ones asked to be the beachcombers wandering the shoreline, sifting through the debris and beginning to take the pieces they find to build something new in the wake of the destruction.

What they re-build won’t be the same as what it was before. But it can be just as strong and as beautiful if we all come together to create it.

It’s up to all of us to rebuild a new relationship.  All Canadians: teachers and students and construction workers and lawyers and police officers and parents. And especially those of us gathered in this room.

All of us, including the Chiefs in this room, need to challenge ourselves on our approach to governance. We need to constantly be ensuring that all voices in the community are heard, and served by their leadership. We can’t forget what we are all here to do. To serve our communities.

Decades ago now, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples described many of the concerns I hear today from? Indigenous youth. The commission told us how youth are wary of government. Federal government certainly, but also Indigenous government. That their concerns are not taken seriously, that their voices are not heard.

The advice of the Royal Commission was right then, and it's right today - that's why we all should support a vision of governance in communities that work for, respond to, and is inclusive of Indigenous youth. This is something we can and must do together.

In the spirit of honouring our youth as well who begin the journey and don’t ever quit, let’s agree that we move forward to build our visions of our country that will propel us into the next centuries.

I have seen firsthand the struggles of so many of our northern and remote communities, and every opportunity has cemented my resolve and deepened my understanding of reconciliation.  It made me see very clearly what reconciliation means.

It means that if you are a child living on reserve, you should be able to turn on the tap and have clean water come out.  Water that you can drink, and bathe in, without fear.

It means that if you are a parent, when you say goodnight to your child you know that your child will be alive and well the next morning when you awake.

It means that if you are an Indigenous woman, you should not fear violence perpetrated against you when you walk down the street.

These are just a few examples of things most Canadians take for granted. Things I know that everyone gathered here wants for their communities. My government is acting on these issues.

Another fundamental issue is education.  Simply put, we need to do a better job of improving education and educational outcomes for Indigenous students, the fastest-growing demographic in schools across the country.

Education both in the classroom, and out of it. First Nations-led, First Nations- governed, culturally appropriate and sensitive education takes many forms, and is found in many different settings: in the classroom, in the home, and on the land.

I believe that reconciliation will have firmly taken root in this country when the rest of Canada can look at the schools of First Nations communities as the shining light for a full and well-rounded education in all its many forms.  When First Nations- governed schools are the envy of others.

Indigenous control of Indigenous education within a new nation-to-nation relationship, is a means to an end in ensuring culturally appropriate and quality education for Indigenous students. 

The desire is there to make this a reality. And so is the energy, and the willpower. Let’s all agree tonight to work together on a nation-to-nation level to make this an achievable goal, moving forward.

To nuture a nation-to-nation relationship, there has to be trust. Mutual trust.

I refuse to engage in or to ever use policies that aim to ignore, and then belittle, then attack, and finally blame the recipients of that bad policy.

If we are to move forward in a nation-to-nation relationship, we have to try new things.  To take risks, even.  Some of what we try will work, some of it won’t.  Some of it will work for some nations, but not others. But we can’t be afraid to try.  Part of rebuilding trust includes being willing to try, together.

Reconciliation does not mean that we, or even all members within this proud assembly, will agree on everything.

I know that there are people in this room who deeply disagree with our position to move ahead with the Kinder Morgan pipeline. I know there are people here who agree with it. I also know that there are people who deeply disagree with our position not to move forward with the Northern Gateway pipeline, just as there are those who agree with it.

The test of our relationship is not whether we’ll always agree. The test of our relationship is whether we can still move forward, together.

Working together also means sharing what we know and learning from each other.  Whether that’s traditional knowledge or statistical data, if we are to collectively work on helping communities heal and succeed, this is vital. All of us need hard data in order to make decisions both small and large.

Those of us gathered in this room have the historic opportunity to define, together, what this relationship based on recognition will look like for generations to come. 

Let’s not allow others to define our relationship for us or squander this extraordinary opportunity out of fear, mistrust or doubt.

Let’s never give others the chance to think that we can’t make this work, or don’t care to.

Instead, let’s look at the road ahead and take each step together with resolve.  We’re in the early days of this journey. 

I know that we will disagree at times – on which path to take, or at what pace.  Some of us might want to push on, others will need to rest. 

The important thing is that we keep moving forward, and that we keep moving forward together.

Because our reward at the end is not a destination.  It’s a new and stronger and better Canada.

I did not take lightly what I said to each minister when I asked them to be in my Cabinet: no relationship is more important to me and to Canada than the one with Indigenous Peoples.

It is time for a renewed, nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous Peoples, one that is based on recognition of rights, respect, co-operation, and partnership.

We are truly on a Journey of the Nishiyuu, a Journey of the People.

On our journey we need to speak openly and honestly – bluntly, if we have to –just as we need to listen to the wisdom of our own elders.

And we must never forget the passion and energy of our youth.

All of them are watching us.

All of Canada is listening to us.

Let’s do right – in memory of those who have come before us, and in sacred respect for generations to follow.   

Miigwetch. Kinanaskomitin.

Mashi cho. Gilakas'la. Tshinashkumitinau. Thank you. Merci. 

Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us today.

Just over a year ago, Canadians elected a new government. Their marching orders for us were clear: build an economy that works for me and my family, and protect the environment so we can leave a better, cleaner country to our kids.

Voters rejected the old thinking that what is good for the economy is bad for the environment. They embraced the idea that we need strong environmental policies if we expect to develop our natural resources and get them to international markets.

Canadians know that strong action on the environment is good for the economy. It makes us more competitive, by fostering innovation and reducing pollution. Canadians value clean air and water, beautiful coasts and wilderness, and refuse to accept that they must be compromised in order to create growth.

We agree.

Since last November, we have worked hard to put in place a policy that gives life to these values. A new policy that we believe will create good middle class jobs, and protect the environment for our kids and grandkids.

We approved natural resource projects that meet the highest standards of environmental protection.

We created a policy to put a price on pollution, and an Ocean Protection Plan to preserve our coasts.

And we just announced our intention to phase out coal-powered electricity in Canada by 2030, all while expanding clean power sources. This phase out will prevent more than 1,000 premature deaths and save taxpayers billions of dollars in health costs.

We are doing all of this because we know the world is changing, and Canada must change with it. Climate change is real. It is here. And it cannot be wished or voted away.

Canadians know this, and they know we need to transition to a clean energy economy. We owe it to ourselves to make our economy more competitive, and to our kids to leave them a cleaner environment.

But we also know that this transition will take investment, and it won’t happen in a day. We need to create good jobs and strong growth to pay for it.

Canada is a country rich in energy of all kinds. Conventional and renewable. The energy of today and tomorrow. That is a unique and tremendously positive place to be in the world.

I have said many times that there isn’t a country in the world that would find billions of barrels of oil and leave it in the ground while there is a market for it.

But it isn’t enough to just use that resource for our short-term interest.

Our challenge is to use today’s wealth to create tomorrow’s opportunity. Ultimately, this is about leaving a better country for our kids than the one we inherited from our parents.

Today, we are taking a strong step in that direction.

We are here to announce the Government of Canada’s decisions on major energy projects, and the fulfillment of some very significant commitments we made to Canadians during last fall’s election campaign.

We said that major pipelines could only get built if we had a price on carbon, and strong environmental protections in place. We said that Indigenous peoples must be respected, and be a part of the process.  We also said that we would only approve projects that could be built and run safely.

And that’s how we’ve come to our decisions today.

First, the Government of Canada has approved the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Expansion Project.

This pipeline will twin a line that has been in operation since 1953, which extends from Edmonton, Alberta, to Burnaby, British Columbia. The project will effectively triple our capacity to get Canadian energy resources to international markets beyond the Unites States.

It will create 15,000 new, middle class jobs – the majority of them in the trades. This major initiative will get hardworking Canadians back to work, put food on the table for middle class families, and grow and strengthen our communities.

It will give much needed new hope to thousands of hard-working people in Alberta’s conventional energy sector, who have suffered a great deal over the past few years.

Aside from the many and obvious economic benefits, we approved this project because it meets the strictest of environmental standards, and fits within our national climate plan.

We will require that Kinder Morgan meet or exceed all 157 of the binding conditions set out by the National Energy Board. These conditions address potential impacts on Indigenous communities, the protection of local wildlife, and the offset of greenhouse gas emissions during construction.

And let me say this definitively: We could not have approved this project without the leadership of Premier Notley, and Alberta’s Climate Leadership Plan – a plan that commits to pricing carbon and capping oilsands emissions at 100 megatonnes per year.

We want to be clear on this point, because it is important and sometimes not well understood. Alberta’s climate plan is a vital contributor to our national strategy. It has been rightly celebrated as a major step forward by industry and the environmental community.

It caps emissions from oilsands over the mid-term, but allows for production to increase from present levels. Today, Canada’s pipelines are operating at full capacity. That means any significant new production must find another way to get to market. Those modes of transport are less safe than pipelines.

Indeed, we know that new, state of the art pipelines provide the safest route to get our resources to market. This is not an argument. It is a fact. So from this perspective, creating new pipeline capacity is the most responsible decision we could make to ensure public safety and mitigate risk.   

We also could not approve this project without the best in class marine safety standards and capability we are putting in place through the Government of Canada’s new Oceans Protection Plan. The Trans Mountain expansion will increase vessel traffic in the Burrard Inlet by 13% overall, and the Oceans Protection Plan will make sure that any risk coming from increased vessel traffic in Burrard Inlet is properly mitigated.

We understand — and share — the deep and abiding sense of responsibility British Columbians feel for our spectacular west coast. Indeed, it is a personal issue for me. I spent much of my childhood on the coast and on the water with my grandparents. I worked and lived in BC for years as a teacher.

Now, I have heard and listened very carefully to the many diverse perspectives that exist in BC on this project. Indeed, one of its most articulate and substantive critics is a caucus colleague, Terry Beech.

Others will be opposed to this project for their own reasons. We respect that, and we respect their right to hold and voice their beliefs.

But to them — and to all Canadians — I want to say this: if I thought this project was unsafe for the BC coast, I would reject it. This is a decision based on rigorous debate, on science and on evidence. We have not been and will not be swayed by political arguments -- be they local, regional or national.

We have made this decision because we are convinced it is safe for BC, and it is the right one for Canada. It is a major win for Canadian workers, Canadian families, and the Canadian economy.

Second, we have also approved the Line 3 Replacement Project.

This project replaces over 1,000km of an existing pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, to Gretna, Manitoba. It will create 7,000 new, good jobs for tradespeople. It will be required to meet or exceed 37 binding conditions from the National Energy Board.

Fundamentally, this is a safety issue.

On Line 3, the reality is this: This aging pipeline is in dire need of replacement. Once completed, this new infrastructure will increase efficiency, improve workplace and environmental safety, and ensure that the latest technology is in place to prevent leaks.

Trans Mountain’s unique strategic value is it will give traditional Canadian energy resources access to international markets beyond the United States. Line 3 will renew aging infrastructure to ensure we can continue to supply resources to our most important and valued trading partner.

Taken together, these projects will create thousands of good, middle class jobs for Canadians. They’ll also generate billions of dollars in government revenue at all levels.

That’s money that can be invested in our hospitals, roads, and clean energy initiatives.

These projects have received government approval because they meet our standards on the environment. But not all pipelines meet these strict criteria.

Today, we are also announcing that the Government of Canada has directed the National Energy Board to dismiss the application for the Northern Gateway Pipelines Project.

It has become clear that this project is not in the best interests of the local affected communities, including Indigenous peoples.

The Great Bear Rainforest is no place for a pipeline, and the Douglas Channel is no place for oil tanker traffic.

Even before we formed government, we were clear about our intentions to protect the Great Bear Rainforest and Sea. This unique and beautiful ecosystem thrives with diverse wildlife, and supplies an abundant and sustainable economy to the tens of thousands of people who depend on its health. It is a jewel of Canada’s west coast.

Finally, I am also pleased to announce that we will keep our commitment to implement a moratorium on crude oil tanker shipping on British Columbia’s north coast.

After consulting at length with people who live and work there – including Indigenous partners – we’ve heard firsthand how detrimental crude oil tanker traffic is to this region.

Very shortly, we’ll introduce legislation to make this tanker moratorium the law.

As a grandson of BC, I strongly believe that this moratorium – coupled with the rejection of the Northern Gateway Pipeline – is the right call for the people of this province, and for Canada.

The four decisions we’ve announced today were all made after rigorous consultation and examination of the evidence.

We believe they will help provide the growth and resources we need to spur Canada’s clean energy transition. We believe they prove that responsible resource development can go hand in hand with strong environmental protection.

We believe they are safe, responsible and in the interest of all Canadians.

Most importantly, we believe they will help achieve the vital mission Canadians sent us here to achieve: to make progress. To leave a cleaner, more prosperous country to our kids than the one we inherited from our parents.

These Decisions reflect a true team effort, and we are very much looking forward to taking your questions.

Hello, Everyone.

It is a real pleasure for me to be with you today—as Prime Minister of Canada, but especially as a proud Francophone.  

I would like to thank the President of the Republic of Madagascar and the Malagasy people for their warm welcome. I would also like to mention that the President studied at a Canadian university, the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières. So his background is an indication of the wide variety of ties that are being formed between the countries and citizens of the Francophone world.

I would also like to thank my good friend, the Secretary General and former Governor General of Canada, Michaëlle Jean, for her great work at the head of the International Organisation of La Francophonie. Michaëlle, your leadership is a source of pride for all Canadians.

The IOF is an organization that is making an important contribution in a constantly changing world, through its actions and its shared values.

For Canadians, membership in La Francophonie is based on a common language, history and culture that unite us from one end of our vast nation to the other. And it is also a window into a rich and diverse world, with plenty of differences, but united in its values and aspirations.  

And so, although many challenges remain, there are also many opportunities.

The countries of Africa play a central role in La Francophonie.

As you know, Africa is the continent with the youngest population in the world. This represents boundless potential for its countries, but for also for Canada, which is re-engaging with Africa to be a reliable long-term partner.   

As a father and as the minister responsible for Youth, I take every opportunity to remind people that our youth are not the leaders of tomorrow, they are already the leaders of today!

Our challenge is to give them a strong voice, to listen to them and to incorporate their viewpoints in our decisions. Our challenge is also to give them and subsequent generations a clean and healthy environment by providing the means to actively combat pollution and climate change. One way to do this is by implementing the Paris Agreement.

Young people today are citizens of the world—they want to discover, learn, broaden their horizons. They are open-minded and have a thirst for freedom and equality that no other generation before them has matched.  

So let’s let them contribute!

All of us must also ensure that women and girls are given their rightful place.  

I am a feminist. And I am extremely proud of that.

Women and girls have a key role to play in politics, in business, in conflict resolution and in peacekeeping. They must fully participate in society. And it is not just up to women to speak out, but we men need to as well. It is our fight, too.

Because when women and girls succeed, we all reap the benefits.

But for women to succeed, we must first ensure that their human rights are respected. The right to live without violence, the right to free choice in matters of their sexual and reproductive health, the right to equality, and the right to participate fully and completely in society.

And yet, these rights are still violated far too often. Women and girls are victims of physical and sexual violence. They are married off, often at a young age, without their consent. They cannot freely and safely access abortion. They are subjected to genital mutilation.  

Enough! There is no excuse for such practices, for such violations of their human rights. All of us together, women and men, have the duty to create the conditions that women and girls need to reach their full potential.

Members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities are suffering in too many countries, including in some member countries of La Francophonie here today. We owe them the same respect, the same rights and the same dignity as we give all other members of our society.

We are faced with other challenges, too, the foremost being the threat of radicalization and violent extremism.  

We know now that isolated or marginalized individuals are more likely to become radicalized or fall into the grips of extremist groups. Conversely, people who feel included, valued and fully appreciated have a much greater chance of making a positive contribution to society.  

Therefore, to prevent radicalization, we must implement prevention strategies. This includes creating a society where diversity is celebrated and where we maintain an ongoing dialogue with members of minority communities.

And because too often our young people are more vulnerable to radicalization, we must do more for them, by offering all young people the vocational training they need so they can enter the job market and help their society thrive.

We often have discussions regarding issues of identity. Canadian identity is built upon the values of diversity, inclusion and democracy. These values are at the very core of our success. They contribute to strengthening and growing our middle class.

We are a multicultural country with two official languages, and we are as proud of our shared values as we are of our differences. Our languages and cultures are a window to the world for our children and those who choose to make Canada home.

I would like to share a few words now, in English, with my Anglophone counterparts, who have embraced the bilingual nature of our country.

Canada’s character as a bilingual country is part of its very fabric. It teaches us every day to be stronger, more open. And Canada’s participation in La Francophonie provides us with a unique platform to promote our values of openness and diversity as well as our agenda of empowerment for all.  

Today, we, the Francophones of Canada, are a vital part of this open and plural society. And it is why we are ready to play a leading role within the international Francophone community.

We have the proof right before us, as Canadians are represented at this Summit not only by the federal government, but also by the governments of Quebec and New-Brunswick. These governments have been long active within the Canadian and international Francophonie, and they have provided outstanding leadership.

The Government of Ontario is now seeking to join the IOF as an observer, which we are all very proud of. Ontario, home to some 600,000 Francophones and millions of francophiles, will certainly make a major contribution to the organization. Canada stands firm behind Ontario’s candidacy and urges all IOF members to do the same.

As a Quebecer, I would also like to applaud the ongoing efforts of the Quebec government to protect and promote the French language. It has gone beyond defending our beautiful language. Not only has the Quebec government ensured the bilingual nature of Canada, but it has also been crucial to the vitality and strength of our language at home and abroad.

We are here for our Francophone communities in Canada and here for Francophones and francophiles across the globe.

We are determined to strengthen the ties that we already have. We are committed to forging new bonds with countries that share our vision of a better, more just world.

My friends, we need to bring about the positive change we want to see. It is our role to share our values with the other Francophone and francophile societies.

The 21st century belongs to us if, together, we are prepared to take on the challenges that we face.

The opportunities open to us are unprecedented; it is up to us to grasp them.

Member countries have a crucial role to play in the legacy that we will leave our children and grandchildren.

By offering a helping hand now, we can meet their expectations and their eagerness:   for a better world that we can build on together in the future.  

Thank you.

Hello everyone! It’s great to be back in Vancouver.

Thanks, Marc, for your hard work, for the warm welcome, and for everything you do as Minister of Transport.

It’s an honour to be here today on the traditional territory of the Coast Salish people, home of the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh.

As many of you know, Transport Canada has been working hard with Indigenous communities across the country lately. So thank you, Marc – to you and your entire team.

And I’d also like to shout out Vancouver Centre’s fantastic and much-beloved Member of Parliament, Dr. Hedy Fry. She continues to do great work on behalf of the people of BC in Ottawa. Thanks for being here, Hedy.

And thanks to our entire BC team.

Thank you, everyone, for being here. This is a really exciting day for Canadians from coast to coast to coast, and I’m glad you could join us.

Let me start by saying that it’s great to be here at HMCS Discovery, and it’s a real pleasure to be back in beautiful British Columbia.

This amazing province is, in many ways, home to me. It has been my whole life –as a kid, as a young adult, and now, as a father and husband. And I’ve got some particularly cherished memories to show for it.

I remember, as a kid, being brought by my grandmother to sailing lessons at Jericho Beach– great memories set against bright blue water and gorgeous views of the North Shore.

And I also remember exploring Cypress Creek with my younger brothers, Sacha and Michel, and my Grandpa Jimmy.

As a young man, I taught French and math at schools across Vancouver, including West Point Grey and Sir Winston Churchill.

And even now, as a father, husband, and leader, I always find myself coming back to the coast.

I kicked off the federal election campaign marching in Vancouver Pride.

I hiked the Grouse Grind last summer.

And a few months back, I spent some quality time with my family, exploring Tofino and surfing at Chesterman Beach.

Now, you may be wondering: Why am I reminding you of all this? Why am I sharing these memories with you?

Well, it’s because I want you to know why I cherish this place. I want you to know why it’s important to me. And I want you to know that, in my capacity as Prime Minister, I will do my best to ensure that my kids – and all of your kids – get to enjoy the West Coast just as I have, just as we all have, for many years to come.

The ongoing incident at Bella Bella is unacceptable. I know this. You know this. Canadians know this. It’s time for a change.

As a community, we need to protect our magnificent oceans – and re-opening the Kitsilano Coast Guard base this summer was an important first step.

But indeed, that was only a down-payment on our larger plan. We must make sure we protect all of our coastlines, not just the one we’re on right now.

As we know, Canada is blessed with some of the most spectacular coastlines in the world. They give Canadians and visitors alike places to live, work, and play.

Our coasts are the traditional territory of Indigenous communities; they are habitats for rich biodiversity and precious ecosystems; and they offer unparalleled economic, recreational, and tourism opportunities.

And it’s up to all of us to keep it that way.

That is why, today, I am very pleased to announce the Government of Canada’s Oceans Protection Plan.

This robust, national plan will protect our oceans and coastlines from the damage that comes from shipping and pollution.

These measures are progressive and proactive, and will ensure the health of our oceans for generations to come.

With this new plan, Canada will have one of the best marine safety and emergency preparation systems in the world.

These strong measures are urgently needed and long overdue. This represents the most significant investment ever made to protect our oceans and coastlines.

So let me tell you about just a few of the measures outlined in our plan.

We’re going to strengthen the Canadian Coast Guard and boost their presence to ensure our waters are better protected 24/7.

We’re going to get tough on businesses and industries that pollute along our coasts.

We’re going to preserve and restore our marine ecosystems, by introducing a new fund for coastal habitat restoration. In that same vein, we will introduce new legislation to increase vessel owner responsibility and liability for abandoned and wrecked vessels. 

We’re going to re-open the Maritime Rescue Sub-Centre in St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador.

We’re going to collect and share better information on marine tanker and vessel traffic with coastal communities, so we can work together to prevent spills.

And, most important, we invite Indigenous communities to partner with us to effectively co-manage our oceans. This includes launching Indigenous Community Response Teams here in BC to help respond to coastal emergencies, if and when they arise.

All this is in addition to many other important measures that will protect our coastlines, and the people who call them home.

This ambitious, forward-thinking plan is all about protecting the environment, ensuring efficient transportation, maintaining public safety, and yes, creating jobs.

Our Oceans Protection Plan will result in a truly world class system for marine protection and emergency preparedness – one that will meet or surpass the world-leading marine safety practices of Alaska and Norway.

And as a grandson of BC, I’m thrilled at what this means for folks out here.

You know, as a government, everything we do, and every action we take, is done with one goal in mind: We want to leave our kids and grandkids with a better place to live – whether we’re creating good, well-paying jobs for the middle class; ensuring our communities are safe and protected; or taking the necessary action to safeguard our environment.

And by working together with our partners along the coasts and across the country, I know we can preserve our coastlines for generations to come.

Thank you very much for being here today. 

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

I have had many opportunities over the past year – over the past number of years, really – to reflect on Canada’s success.

And every time we have done something well, whether it was decades ago with Medicare and CPP, or more recently getting our national debt under control in the 1990s, taking steps to ensure the stability of our banking system, or responding to a global refugee crisis, our success has been rooted in two things.

First, that when we see a problem, we don’t walk away from it, or deny that it exists. Instead, we lean in. We work hard – and we work together – to solve the problems that come our way.

And second, when we say we’re going to do something, we follow through. We live up to our commitments. The world expects that of us. So do the markets. And so do our fellow Canadians.

It is in that very Canadian spirit of solving problems and keeping promises that I address the House today, and share the government’s plan for pricing carbon pollution.

After decades of inaction, after years of missed opportunities, we will finally take real and concrete measures to build a clean economy, create more opportunities for Canadians, and make our world better for our children and grandchildren.

Mr. Speaker, we will not walk away from science, and we will not deny the unavoidable.

With the plan put forward by the government, all Canadian jurisdictions will have put a price on carbon pollution by 2018.

To do that, the government will set a floor price for carbon pollution.

The price will be set at a level that will help Canada reach its targets for greenhouse gas emissions, while providing businesses with greater stability and improved predictability.

Provinces and territories will have a choice in how they implement this pricing. They can put a direct price on carbon pollution, or they can adopt a cap-and-trade system, with the expectation that it be stringent enough to meet or exceed the federal benchmark.

The government proposes that the price on carbon pollution should start at a minimum of $10 per tonne in 2018, rising by $10 each year to $50 per tonne in 2022.

Provinces and territories that choose cap-and-trade systems will need to decrease emissions in line to both Canada’s target and to the reductions expected in jurisdictions that choose a price-based system.

If neither price nor cap and trade is in place by 2018, the Government of Canada will implement a price in that jurisdiction.

Whatever approach is chosen, this policy will be revenue neutral for the federal government. All revenues generated under this system will stay in the province or territory where they are generated.

Because pollution crosses borders, all provinces must do their part.

And to make sure that this plan continues to meet Canada’s targets, it will be reviewed at the end of five years, in 2022.

As we are talking today, the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change is discussing the details of this plan with our provincial and territorial partners.

Over the next two months, the government will work closely with the provinces, territories and Aboriginal organizations to finalize this plan.

These discussions are essential, because we know that no plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can succeed without the help of our provincial and territorial partners, who have already shown great leadership in tackling climate change.

I am especially looking forward to meeting with provincial premiers and Aboriginal leaders on December 8 and 9 to finalize the details of this pan-Canada plan to fight climate change.

This framework will include not only the plan for pricing carbon pollution, but will also pave the way forward to better support innovation and jobs in the clean energy sector, manage the effects of climate change, and improve our capacity for adaptation and climate resilience.

I’d like to take this opportunity again to congratulate the provinces who have led on this file while the previous federal government abdicated its responsibility to all Canadians.

That era is over.

Of course, a plan is only as good as the principles on which it is based. And so I would like to take a few minutes, Mr. Speaker, to talk about why the government has decided to act now to put pricing on carbon pollution.

There are many reasons to act now, and I am certain that the Members opposite are as familiar with those reasons as the government is, even if their track record suggests otherwise.

But today I would like to identify three of the biggest reasons why pricing carbon pollution is right for Canada, and for Canadians.

First, setting a price for carbon pollution will give us a significant advantage while we build a clean-growth economy.

A reasonable and predictable price for carbon pollution will encourage innovation because businesses will have to find new ways to reduce their emissions and pollute less.

It will also make our businesses more competitive.

The global economy is becoming increasingly clean, and Canada cannot afford to be left behind.

Around the world, the markets are changing. They are moving away from products and services that create carbon pollution and turning to cleaner and more sustainable options.

By giving Canadian businesses the incentives they need to make this change, we are opening the door to new opportunities.

And you do not need to take my word for it, Mr. Speaker. Last summer, business leaders from across the country spoke out in favour of carbon pricing.

Retail leaders like Canadian Tire, Loblaws, IKEA and Air Canada.

Energy producers like Enbridge, Shell and Suncor.

Natural resource companies like Barrick Gold, Resolute Forest Products and Teck Resources.

And financial institutions like BMO, Desjardins, Royal Bank, Scotiabank and TD.

These businesses support carbon pricing because they know that – when it is done well – it is the most effective way to reduce emissions while continuing to grow the economy.

They know that a clean environment and a strong economy go hand in hand.

They are anxious to take advantage of the opportunities inherent in a clean-growth economy.

And they, like the government, recognize that if we do not act now, the Canadian economy will suffer.

The second reason to move ahead with pricing carbon pollution is the benefit it will deliver to Canadians – especially for the middle class and those working hard to join it.

As the business leaders I just mentioned put it, “… carbon pricing uses the market to drive clean investment decisions. It encourages innovation.”

That innovation brings with it new and exciting job prospects for Canadian workers.

As one example, last year, nearly a third of a trillion dollars was invested globally in renewable power – almost 50% more than was invested in power from fossil fuels. That’s a trend that will only accelerate, Mr. Speaker.

Simply put, there are billions of dollars, and hundreds of thousands of good, well-paying jobs on the table for the countries that get this right. Engineering, design and programming jobs. Manufacturing jobs – whether it’s solar panels or electric vehicles. Jobs researching and processing biofuels. Among many, many examples.

If we do not take full advantage of these opportunities now before us, we are doing Canadians a tremendous disservice.

Finally, I think that all Canadians will understand the third reason why we must move forward with pricing carbon pollution.

It has been proven that it is a good way to prevent heavy polluters from emitting greenhouse gases that fuel climate change and threaten the entire planet.

Carbon pricing is an effective way to reduce the pollution that threatens air quality and the quality of the oceans’ water.

Just last week, the World Health Organization published a report that said that 9 out of 10 people live in places with poor air quality. The consequences for human health are tremendous and devastating: each year, 3 million deaths are linked to air pollution.

We must – and we will – do better.

We’ve seen what can happen when governments take a stand for cleaner air. In 2005, in Toronto, there were 53 smog days. A decade later, thanks in large part to the phase-out of coal-fired generating stations, there were zero smog days.

This is a very big deal if your child has asthma, and can’t go outside to play with her friends during her summer vacation. Or if you have grandparents who have to miss out on family events because they find it difficult to breathe the air in their own backyard.

And if you live in Canada’s north, or in our coastal communities, or, really, Mr. Speaker, in any community that is subject to extreme weather conditions and the resulting floods, droughts, and wildfires, then the effects of climate change itself cannot be denied.

There is no hiding from climate change. It is real, and it is everywhere.

We cannot undo the last 10 years of inaction. What we can do is make a real and honest effort – today and every day – to protect the health of our environment, and with it, the health of all Canadians.

The Governor of the Bank of England – one of Canada’s best exports, by the way – has spoken to this issue on many occasions. And Mr. Carney has an interesting term for it. He calls the unwillingness to act “the tragedy of the horizon.”

What he means is that the truly catastrophic effects of climate change will be felt in the future. Or as he puts it, “beyond the traditional horizons of most actors, imposing a cost on future generations that the current one has no direct incentive to fix.”

With great respect to Mr. Carney – because I think when it comes to climate change, we are very much on the same page – I believe that current actors, such as the government, do have a direct incentive to fix things.

And if I may speak from a personal point of view, Mr. Speaker, I myself have three motivations. Their names are Xavier, Ella-Grace and Hadrien.

And I am not the only one who is concerned about the type of world that we will leave to the next generation and to generations after that.

From community to community, I have talked to parents and grandparents, who shared with me their concerns for the future, and who have challenged the government – and their provincial and community leaders – to take action immediately to avoid tragic and devastating consequences.

We hear their concerns, and we respect their voices. And it is because we respect the desire of Canadians that we will move forward with carbon pollution pricing.

Mr. Speaker, as you know, the government is not obliged to seek the approval of Parliament prior to ratifying the Paris Agreement, nor do we need the House to demonstrate its support for the Vancouver Declaration.

We have chosen to bring this issue before the House, however, because we think it is important that all parliamentarians – and through them, all Canadians – be given a chance to debate and vote on this crucial issue.

I look forward to what I hope will be a spirited yet respectful debate on this important topic. It is one that will shape the country we live in for generations to come.

Thank you.

Good afternoon.

Mr. President, fellow delegates, and friends. It is an honour to be with you today.

And it’s wonderful to be here in the great city of New York. Once again this week, New Yorkers showed us how to be resilient and resolute in the face of violent extremism.

On behalf of everybody in this room, let me say directly to the people of New York: you are a model to the world. And we thank you.

It is the responsibility of a leader to spend time with the people they were elected to serve.

If you want the real stories, you have to go where people live. Coffee shops and church basements, mosques and synagogues. Farmer’s markets. Public parks.

It was in places like that that I got the best sense of what Canadians were thinking, and how they were doing. And through the politeness—because we Canadians are always polite, even when we’re complaining—I learnt some things.

I talked with people my age who were trying to be hopeful about their future, but found it tough to make ends meet, even when they were working full time.

I heard from young Canadians who were frustrated. Who told me that they couldn’t get a job because they don’t have work experience, and they couldn’t get work experience because they don’t have a job.

I heard from women and girls who still face inequality in the workplace and violence just because they are women, even in a progressive country like Canada.

I met parents working hard to give their children every chance to succeed, but were afraid that their efforts won’t be enough.

And I had the opportunity to share meals with retired seniors who worked hard their whole lives and are now forced to rely on food banks.

I’ve had too many distressing conversations with Canadians over the past few years. But they made something very clear to me.

Canadians still believe in progress. Or at least, that progress is possible.

But that optimism is mixed with a lot of concern.

Obviously, Canadians are not alone in feeling that way. Those feelings are ubiquitous. That anxiety is a reality.

When leaders are faced with citizens’ anxiety, we have a choice to make.

Do we exploit that anxiety or do we allay it?

Exploiting it is easy. But in order to allay it, we need to be prepared to answer some very direct questions.

What will create the good, well-paying jobs that people want, and need, and deserve?

What will strengthen and grow the middle class, and help those working hard to join it?

What will build an economy that works for everyone?

What will help to make the world a safer, more peaceful place?

To allay people’s anxiety, we need to create economic growth that is broadly shared, because a fair and successful world is a peaceful world.

We need to focus on what brings us together, not what divides us.

For Canada, that means re-engaging in global affairs through institutions like the United Nations. It doesn’t serve our interests—or the world’s—to pretend we’re not deeply affected by what happens beyond our borders.

Earlier this year, we helped negotiate the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. As part of our commitment to implementing that agreement, we announced that Canada would invest $2.65 billion over five years to fund clean, low-carbon growth in developing countries.

In order to help promote peace and security in areas affected by instability, we reaffirmed our support for NATO and committed ourselves to expanding Canada’s role in United Nations peacekeeping operations.

And we hosted the Fifth Global Fund Replenishment Conference, where we increased our contribution by 20% by giving more than $800 million to the Global Fund. And we also encouraged our partners to increase their contributions, making it possible to raise $13 billion in support of ending AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria by 2030.

We’ve done all this—and will do much more—because we believe we should confront anxiety with a clear plan to deal with its root causes.

And we believe we should bring people together around shared purposes like the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Because what is the alternative?

To exploit anxiety?

To turn it into fear and blame?

To reject others because they look, or speak, or pray differently than we do?

You see, in Canada we got a very important thing right. Not perfect, but right.

In Canada, we see diversity as a source of strength, not weakness. Our country is strong not in spite of our differences, but because of them.

And make no mistake: we have had many failures, from the internment of Ukrainian, Japanese and Italian Canadians during the World Wars; to our turning away boats of Jewish and Punjabi refugees; to the shamefully continuing marginalization of Indigenous Peoples.

What matters is that we learn from our mistakes, and recommit ourselves to doing better.

To that end, in recent months, Canadians have opened their arms and their hearts to families fleeing the ongoing conflict in Syria. And from the moment they arrived, those 31,000 refugees were welcomed—not as burdens, but as neighbours and friends. As new Canadians.

That effort brought Canadians together. In an almost unprecedented fashion, the government worked with the business community, engaged citizens and civil society to help the newcomers adapt to their new country.

But our efforts will not truly be successful until those refugees have become established, full-fledged members of the Canadian middle class.

And I want you to know that this objective is within our grasp—not because of what we have done, but because of what they are themselves.

You see, refugees are people with the same hopes and dreams as our own citizens.

But while our people have felt anxiety, Syrians faced catastrophe.

Do you want to know where Syria’s middle class is?

They’re living in refugee camps in Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan.

They’re moving across Europe, looking for a place to set down roots, get their kids back in school, find steady work, and be productive citizens.

Refugee camps are teeming with Syria’s middle class. Doctors and lawyers. Teachers and entrepreneurs. They’re well educated. They work hard. They care about their families. They want a better life—a safer and more secure future for their kids—as we all do.

So when I say that I hope that the Syrian refugees we welcomed will soon be able to join our middle class, I am confident that we can make that happen.

And we’ll do it by offering to them the same things we offer to all our citizens—a real and fair chance at success.

We’re going to do all we can to build a strong middle class in Canada.

We’re going to invest in education, because it gives the next generation the tools they need to contribute to the world economy and succeed.

We’re going to invest in infrastructure because it creates good, well-paying jobs for the middle class and helps to make our communities better places to live, work and invest.

We’re determined to build an economy that works for everyone—not just the wealthiest 1%—so that every person benefits from economic growth.

And we are going to refuse to give in to the pressure of trading our cherished values for easy votes. The world expects better from us, and we expect better from ourselves.

In the end, my friends, there is a choice to be made. Strong, diverse, resilient countries like Canada didn’t happen by accident, and they won’t continue without effort.

Every single day, we need to choose hope over fear, and diversity over division.

Fear has never fed a family nor created a single job.

And those who exploit it will never solve the problems that have created such anxiety.

Our citizens, the nearly 7.5 billion people we collectively serve, are better than the cynics and pessimists think they are.

They want their problems solved not exploited.

Listen, Canada is a modest country. We know we can’t solve these problems alone.

We know we need to do this all together.

We know it will be hard work.

But we’re Canadian. And we’re here to help. 

Thank you Chrystia, for that kind introduction, and thank you also for achieving important progress for Canadian canola farmers, including your father on his farm in Peace River, Alberta.  The work that you've done over these past few days, indeed, over these past many months, has been extraordinary on so many files in helping Canadians, in helping build relationships around the world.

Thank you, Chrystia, for all you’ve done.

It's wonderful to be here tonight.  It's wonderful to see so many friends in the room tonight.  People I didn't expect to see here who’ve come from Canada; people I've met, Chinese investors present in Canada who've gathered here tonight.  This is a wonderful celebration of a tremendous friendship that stretches back through the decades, but mostly will stretch forward decades and decades into the future.

I want to start by thanking the Canada China Business Council, its directors, benefactors, staff, and volunteers, for putting on this tremendous event.  I'd also like to acknowledge three of my many friends who are here with us tonight.

The first is my old friend Raymond Chan, who in 2004 became Canada's first Chinese Canadian cabinet minister.  Thank you for being here tonight, Raymond.

The next is Geng Tan, who's also here with us tonight and a current Member of Parliament.  Geng was born in Hunan and just last fall was elected as Canada's very first Member of Parliament from mainland China.

We also have Shaun Chen here, a strong, young member of our Chinese Canadian caucus.  And although Arnold Chan couldn't be with us here tonight, I know he wishes he could.  Indeed, our Parliament is lucky to have Chinese-Canadians in all political parties, representing communities across Canada in the House of Commons.

Now, Sophie, my wife, my daughter Ella-Grace and I have been in China for a little more than two days, but already we've been deeply touched by the incredible hospitality shown to us, and indeed, to our entire Canadian delegation.  So thank you, once again, for your warm and generous welcome.  It means a tremendous amount to us, and we're honoured to be your guests today, including the guests of His Excellency Yang Xiong, the Mayor of Shanghai.  Thank you all for your welcome.

This visit is taking place at a special time, a special time in the history of Canada as well as in the history of China. In fact, a crucial time in the history of our planet. And with that in mind, I want to share with you the reasons for this visit and what I hope to accomplish while we are here.

First and foremost, this visit is about renewing and deepening the relationship between the people of Canada and the people of China.  As you know, it's a relationship that historically has been close and warm, but more recently has perhaps been a little more distant or unfocused.  So I want to be as clear as I possibly can be on this point: China matters to Canada.

China's growth, its environmental progress, its economic success, the role it plays in the world, and the progress it makes on governance and the rule of law, all of these matter to Canadians and they matter to me.

I see three reasons why a stronger relationship between Canada and China benefits both countries.  The first has to do with strengthening and growing the middle class.  In Canada, we know that the heart of our economy rests with our middle class and all those working hard to join it.

These are the people who get up early every day, take their children to school, use public transit to get to work, and work hard to make ends meet for their family. They don’t ask for much. In fact, when you talk to them – and I have spent a lot of time with thousands of Canadians in communities across the country – you’ll see that all they want in return for their hard work is a real chance to succeed. In return, they simply ask for an opportunity to give their children a better world than the one they inherited from their own parents.

That same spirit, that same drive to do a little better and to be a little better exists everywhere in China as well.  And that's why it's so important to be very clear with people about what a stronger relationship means for our respective economies.

For Canadians it means that our businesses will have greater access to the large and rapidly growing Chinese and Asian economies.  That means a bigger market for quality Canadian food, like beef and pork, of course, but also for lobster and cherries.  It means more customers for Canadian financial services companies and more clients for design and engineering firms.

The rapid and wide-scale structural change now taking place in China's economy also means that trade and investment opportunities will continue to emerge and evolve.  Some of the clean technology now being developed in both countries was not on anyone's radar a generation ago, and we can't take advantage of tomorrow's opportunities if we don't work hard on building good relationships today because we know that when we do build strong and resilient relationships -- when we give Canadian businesses more opportunities to succeed -- they will succeed.  That means more better-paying jobs for Canadians, and when Canadian companies partner with Chinese companies, it means more and better-paying jobs here in China as well.

And so when I say that a stronger relationship between our two countries will benefit both countries, I'm thinking very much of the ways in which we can work together as partners to create jobs and strengthen the middle class in our communities and in yours.

Second, a stronger relationship between Ottawa and Beijing, one that strengthens and grows the middle class, will encourage economic growth as it opens doors and creates new opportunities for both Canadian and Chinese businesses to succeed.  A stronger relationship between Ottawa and Beijing leads to better opportunities between Montreal and Shanghai, Vancouver and Hong Kong, Waterloo and Hangzhou, and so forth.  And not just for the large multinational firms like Manulife and Huawei, but also for small and medium-size businesses like Nova Scotia's JusNova, which thanks to a local joint venture agreement, will be able to build a local manufacturing facility for wild blueberry products.

Or David Bromley Engineering, based in B.C., which will have a chance to deploy its innovative water treatment technology in Northern Alberta, thanks to private sector Chinese investors.

And on the research front we have deals like the one signed with the Sichuan Bohong Group to establish a joint auto engineering research lab at the University of Windsor.

Opportunities exist. They are real and important for jobs. Good, well-paying jobs in Canada and in China. And not just in traditional industries like natural resources or agri-food, but also in new sectors like clean tech.

The opportunities that exist are real and significant.  They don't just exist on paper, they are real jobs, as good, well-paying jobs in Canada and in China. And not just in traditional industries, such as natural resources or agriculture, but also in newer sectors like clean tech.

Now, I know that this room is filled with smart enterprising people who get things done.  But I also know that your work is easier when there is commitment at the highest level to building and nurturing strong, stable, long-term relationships between governments, and that's exactly what we're here to do.

China's leadership plays a central role in driving global economic growth.  Any economic strategy that ignores China or that treats the valuable relationship as anything less than critically important is not just short-sighted, it's irresponsible.

And as I have said, the benefits of a revitalized relationship go both ways.  Canada is an outstanding place to invest.  Canada is recognized as the best country in the G20 to do business.  We're home to the soundest banking system in the world and we have a workforce that is highly-educated and willing to work hard.

That's why smart investors, like the ones helping to create opportunities and jobs through JusNova, David Bromley Engineering, and dozens upon dozens of other examples, are turning to Canada.  Because they know a good deal when they see one.

And third, a stronger relationship will allow us to work together more effectively in a global context.  What we can accomplish by working together will always exceed what we can get by going it alone.  Think of the ways in which our cultural ties are deepened and strengthened by the experiences of young Chinese students who come to Canada to learn in our universities.  Or by the exchange of tourists.  Every year half a million Chinese tourists visit Canada, and it may surprise some of you to learn that similar numbers of Canadians come here every year.  And we're looking forward to seeing those numbers climb with our announcement that 2018 will be the year dedicated to Canada-China tourism.  Although, we're encouraging you all to get a head start, because next year is Canada's 150th birthday and in true Canadian fashion we're throwing open our doors and inviting the world to come celebrate with us.

But, of course, tourism is just one example.  Another example, one that truly has the potential to affect the lives of every person on the planet, is climate change.  Climate change is a global challenge; one that demands a global response.

As signatories to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, Canada and China have committed to both address the challenges that come with climate change and embrace the opportunities that it presents.  We have before us a chance to build a clean growth economy that will help to fight climate change while creating good, well-paying jobs for our citizens.

Just as Canada will look to ways to lead the clean energy transition, we know that China will do the same.  And it is our hope that in doing so we will take advantage of this historic opportunity to work together, to invest in each other, to build in our shared knowledge, and to grow our economies in ways that are as clean as they are competitive.

Finally, I think there are ways in which a stronger relationship makes it easier for our two countries to have regular, frank discussions on issues like good governance, human rights, and the rule of law.  Freedom of expression is a true Canadian value, one protected by our Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  You see, Canada has succeeded, culturally, politically, economically because of our diversity, not in spite of it.

That message was central to the platform that got us elected and has remained at the heart of how we have governed, and it was a message that I carried into my meetings this week, including those with President Xi and Premier Li.

I shared with them my strong conviction that acceptance of diverse perspectives will strengthen China, just as it has Canada.  In a world of rapid change, it is a diversity of ideas and the free ability to express them that drives positive change.  And I remind everyone that as a country that has seen first-hand the benefits of free expression and good governance, Canada encourages China to do more to promote and protect human rights.

In the global village we all have a stake in what happens here.  The success of the world is inexorably linked to China's success.  And I know that these are not easy conversations to have, but they are necessary ones.  And as important as it is to me that our government seeks greater economy cooperation with China, so too must we promote the values that make us good economic partners and good friends.  Friendship should be open, honest, and constructive.  In the end, what I'm after on behalf of 36 million Canadians, is a friendship built to last.

You see, we're Canadians.  We travel with our values and we don't hesitate to share them whenever and wherever we see opportunities.  And actually, there's an opportunity here tonight.  Gentlemen, it's 2016, we need more women at this head table.

So as you see, the future of the Canada-China relationship is one that I'm very passionate about.

It’s important to me because I sincerely believe that a renewed relationship between Canada and China is good for everyone. Because a stronger and more stable relationship can help build and grow the middle class; because a prosperous middle class can, in turn, encourage greater and more prosperous economic growth; and because a stronger relationship will enable both of our countries to work together to satisfy not just our own interests, but also the needs of the entire planet.

Now, before I finish, I want to take a moment to applaud the Canada China Business Council again for all the hard work it has done, in good times and in more challenging times, to foster this most important relationship.  It truly is a relationship that stretches back generations.  Back to my father, who visited this beautiful country many times, including during his time as Prime Minister with me in tow, because he recognized that a relationship with China was important.  Well, not for the first time, and not for the last, he was right about that.

But before that, to Dr. Norman Bethune, whose selflessness and generosity may have been rooted in his Canadian origins but found their highest expression right here in China.  And, of course, our business connections reach back further still, to the Bank of Montreal, Canada's first bank, which was the first to do business with China just three months after it was founded in 1818.

In other words, Canada and China have a long history together.  It's a history we should honour, even as we seek to forge new paths together.

I hope you will continue to work hard to help businesses in Canada and in China seize the opportunities for greater partnership that now lie before us because in the end, we are all served by taking the long view.  I've always believed that the purpose of leadership is to represent the future to the past and to the present.  History has a way of making the most controversial decisions obvious, but that does not diminish the courage of leaders of previous generations.

And now, 45 years down the road, the world is self-evidently better off because they worked so hard to bring China into the global system.

This morning I had the opportunity to hold my daughter's hand along the Great Wall of China.  Let me tell you, when you find yourself walking along a centuries old wall with your seven year-old daughter, the least you can do is think a few decades down the road. Then the answers to the biggest questions become clear.

Do we want a world built on diversity or division? One that prospers by expanding trade and creating growth, or one that makes us all poorer because we've thrown up walls and retreated behind them?  One where we work hard and work together to overcome our differences and build on common ground, or one where we keep our distance from people whose history and culture differ from our own?

Well, we're going through a period of enormous change, my friends, in China, in Canada, and everywhere in between.  No country, no business, indeed, no person will be unaffected.

The question before us is, therefore, whether we engage and actively work to choose and shape and seize our future, or fearfully and passively let it happen around us.  Well, I know that you all are here because you've already answered that question the right way.  It is the choice previous generations would expect of us, and for which our children will be thankful.

We have a lot of work ahead of us, my friends, and I, for one, couldn't be more looking forward to it.

Merci beaucoup, thank you, xiè xie.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by acknowledging the hard work done by many of my colleagues.

From my own caucus, I’d like to thank the Members from Surrey-Newton and Winnipeg North for their tireless advocacy. They have petitioned the Canadian government for years to make the apology that will be made today. I thank them for their commitment to this cause.

From the Opposition benches, special mention must be made of the Members from Calgary Heritage, Calgary Midnapore and the former Member for Surrey North. Each deserves recognition for the work they have done to seek resolution for victims and their families.

As do the many organizations that have sought the same, in particular, the Professor Mohan Singh Memorial Foundation.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise in this House to offer an apology on behalf of the Government of Canada, for our role in the Komagata Maru incident.

More than a century ago, a great injustice took place.

On May 23, 1914, a steamship sailed into Burrard Inlet in Vancouver. On board were 376 passengers of Sikh, Muslim and Hindu origin.

Those passengers, like millions of immigrants to Canada since, came seeking better lives for their families. Greater opportunities. A chance to contribute to their new home.

Those passengers chose Canada. And when they arrived here, they were rejected.

They were rejected because in the early years of the last century, the Government of Canada put in place a law that prohibited passengers from disembarking in Canada if the vessel they were on had stopped at any point during its journey here.

This would have prevented immigrants from faraway countries such as India from entering Canada, because in that era, it was impossible to travel great distances by sea without making any stops.

Because of this law, when the Komagata Maru arrived in Canada, only a small number of passengers were allowed to disembark. The ship, and all remaining passengers on it, was ordered to leave.

Members of the local Sikh community tried to convince authorities to reverse their decision, but those efforts were unsuccessful.

And on July 23, 1914 – two months after it arrived – the Komagata Maru was escorted out of harbour by the Canadian military, and forced to return to India, where 19 passengers were killed and many others imprisoned.

Mr. Speaker, Canada does not bear alone the responsibility for every tagic mistake that occurred with the Komagata Maru and its passengers.

But Canada’s government was, without question, responsible for the laws that prevented these passengers from immigrating peacefully and securely.

For that, and for every regrettable consequence that followed, we are sorry.

I apologize, first and foremost, to the victims of the incident.

No words can fully erase the pain and suffering they experienced. Regrettably, the passage of time means that none are alive to hear our apology today.

Still, we offer it, fully and sincerely. 

For our indifference to your plight. 

For our failure to recognize all that you had to offer. 

For the laws that discriminated against you, so senselessly.

And for not formally apologizing sooner.

For all these things, we are truly sorry.

I also wish to apologize to the descendants of the passengers of the Komagata Maru, including those who are here with us here today. 

We can never know what your lives would have been like had your relatives been welcomed to Canada. 

The ways in which your lives would have been different.

The ways in which Canada would have been enriched. 

Those possibilities are lost to history.

For that – and to you – we apologize.

Just as we apologize for past wrongs, so too must we commit ourselves to positive action – to learning from the mistakes of the past, and to making sure that we never repeat them.

That is the unique promise and potential of Canada.

We believe that every person – no matter who they are, no matter where they came from – deserves a real and fair chance at success. Canada’s South Asian community exemplifies this success every day.

We believe that our diversity is a source of strength. That we are strong not in spite of our differences, but because of them.

And we believe in the values enshrined in our Charter of Rights and Freedoms, including multiculturalism. Our government will ensure that these values are always upheld.

Mr. Speaker, before I finish, I would like to acknowledge one more Member who has helped to bring the Komagata Maru incident to our national attention – the Minister of National Defence.

Before entering political life, the Minister was the commanding officer of The British Columbia Regiment Duke of Connaught’s Own – the same regiment that once forced out the Komagata Maru.

A century ago, the Minister’s family might well have been turned away from Canada. Today, the Minister sits beside us, here, in this House.

In a House that includes immigrants. That includes the daughters and sons – the granddaughters and grandsons – of immigrants.

The very makeup of this House should remind all of us that when we have the choice between opening our arms to those in need or closing our hearts to them, we must always choose the more compassionate path.

When we see injustice, we must speak up, and attempt to make things right.

When we make mistakes, we must apologize, and recommit ourselves to doing better.

Mr. Speaker, Canada is a country unlike any other. We are blessed to call it home.

Let us always endeavour to do better, and to be better.

Let us do that in honour of the victims of the Komagata Maru incident, and every courageous person who leaves behind family and familiar things, to bring to Canada the very best of who they are.

Thank you.


Thank you, Secretary General.

I want to thank you personally for your continued leadership on this important issue. It’s safe to say that we would not be here today if it was not for all the hard work that you and President Hollande put into making the Paris Agreement a reality.

On behalf of Canadians and all world citizens, thank you for all you have done.

I’m honoured to be back here at the United Nations, especially today, on Earth Day.

I can’t think of a better place – nor a better day – to add Canada’s signature to the historic Paris Agreement on climate change.

As I said last November in Paris, Canada views climate change not just as a challenge, but as an opportunity.

A chance to build a clean growth economy that will help to fight climate change while creating good, well-paying jobs.

It’s a challenge we’re already embracing.

In the months since Paris, our government has met with our provincial and territorial premiers, as well as Indigenous and municipal leaders.

Together, we’re creating a plan that will help us meet or exceed our emissions targets and encourage clean economic growth.

To encourage actions that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we’re investing billions in a low-carbon economy fund.

To get clean technology to market faster, we’re making immediate investments to support clean tech research and development.

And alongside 19 other countries, we’ve signed on to Mission Innovation – a global partnership that aims to double government investment in clean energy innovation over five years, while encouraging private sector leadership in clean energy.

These actions are just the beginning.

We’re not making these investments simply to be nice, although I know Canada does have a reputation to uphold in that department.

We’re making these investments – and we’re following through on our commitments – because it’s the right thing to do. For our environment and our economy, and as part of the global community.

The humanitarian case is clear. We know that it will be the world’s poorest citizens who will be hardest hit by climate change – displaced by rising sea levels, left hungry by failed crops, more vulnerable to disease.

Climate change will make more difficult every other challenge we face – whether it’s ensuring safe and secure food and water or responding to the needs of refugees.

The business case is equally clear. Last year, nearly a third of a trillion dollars was invested globally in renewable power – nearly 50% more than was invested in power from fossil fuels.

That’s a trend that will continue to grow, and it’s one that represents a tremendous opportunity for Canada. One that we cannot – and will not – ignore.

At the same time, Canada’s ambition cannot end with making sure that we alone make the most of a challenging situation. Developing countries have a role to play, too.

They shouldn’t be punished for a problem they didn’t create, nor should they be deprived the opportunities for clean growth that developed nations are now pursuing.

That is why Canada will also invest $2.65 billion over the next five years to help the developing world grow in a cleaner, more sustainable way.

These actions – along with tabling the Paris Agreement in the House of Commons next month and its eventual ratification later this year – confirm Canada’s commitment. Not just to the United Nations, but to each other.

Because it’s only when nations work together that we have any hope of addressing climate change.

It’s only when we work together that we can learn from each other, build on shared knowledge, and develop economies that are as clean as they are competitive.

At the end of the Paris negotiations, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said of the resulting agreement that “what was once unthinkable has now become unstoppable.”

Today, with my signature, I give you our word that Canada’s efforts will not cease.

Climate change will test our intelligence, our compassion and our will. But we are equal to that challenge.

I encourage other signatories to move swiftly to follow through on their commitments, and encourage those countries that are not in a position to sign today to follow shortly.

In every possible sense, we are all in this together.

Together, we can make this a better world. Thank you.


Good afternoon everyone. It’s my absolute pleasure to be here.

You know, when I was asked to be a part of this event, I thought a lot about what I wanted to say.

I thought we could talk about the importance of getting young people engaged in the political process – but I’m pretty sure you know how I feel about that.

Or about how grassroots movements can be amazing catalysts for change – but again, I’m a fairly open book when it comes to that stuff.

Ultimately, I decided that I wanted to talk to you today not as your Prime Minister, but as your Minister of Youth. Which is the portfolio I assigned myself, by the way.

I wanted to take on that extra responsibility because the challenges young people face have always been important to me, whether as a teacher or a volunteer or a politician.  Youth issues are Canada’s issues.  There is no separating the two.  

Now, I know that when people are cynical about politics – both young and old – they tend to have the same complaint. They say that politicians are “all talk and no action.”

Well, this is a lecture and Q&A format.  That means that I’m going to have to do some talking.  But what I want to focus on today are the actions that our government is taking to invest in Canada’s youth.

Specifically, I want to touch on empowering young Canadians, on what we’re doing to help young Canadians get good jobs and work experience, and on the importance of equality and inclusion.

There’s no question that young Canadians are interested in politics.  This room proves it.  And so does the ballot box.

In the last election, Statistics Canada found that 18-24 year olds reported voting at a rate 12 percent higher than the previous election. And that figure could rise even higher next time, if we put in the work needed to help young people feel empowered and engaged.

In the next election in 2019, there will be 1.5 million first-time voters.  We need to make sure that these future voters – now students in high school – are given an active role in the decision-making processes that will fundamentally shape their lives.

So, what does that really mean?  What does it look like in practice?

Well, as Minister of Youth, it will be my job to make sure that Cabinet considers items from the perspective of young Canadians.  And I’ll support my Cabinet colleagues in applying that same lens to the work that their ministry undertakes.

To keep me up to speed on the issues that matter most to young Canadians, I’ll be launching the Youth Advisory Council made up of Canadians aged 16 to 24.

And to make sure that young Canadians think about meaningful careers in government, we will work to modernize the public service. You have so much to give, and your voices and perspectives are needed like never before.

Your goals, your hopes, and your dreams for a better life will inform every decision this government makes.  That is my promise to you.  

When it comes to getting good jobs and work experience, there’s a familiar refrain among young people.  I hear it in every community I visit.  Young people tell me that they can’t get a job because they don’t have any work experience, and they can’t get any work experience because they don’t have a job.

It’s a vicious circle.  And our new government is taking steps to help break it.

We’re establishing an expert panel on youth employment to assess the barriers that vulnerable youth face in finding and keeping jobs.  We need to better understand those challenges.

At the same time, we know that you need help now, not months or years from now.   That’s why last month’s budget included real measures to address youth unemployment and underemployment, and real help for young people seeking their first jobs.

That work starts in the classroom.

To start, we’re investing in actual classrooms. Over the next 3 years, we’ll be investing $2 billion in labs and buildings on college and university campuses.

But perhaps more important, we’re investing in students – so that when young people go off to school, they can afford to stay in school.

In Canada, every young person should have the opportunity to go to university or college. It shouldn’t matter where you were born, or how much money your parents make. We took real steps toward making that a reality with Budget 2016.

We’ll boost Canada Student Grants by up to $1,000 per year for postsecondary students from low and middle income families. This means more money in the pockets of 360,000 students each and every year.

And our budget also includes more help for recent graduates.

Beginning later this fiscal year, no student graduating from college or university will have to start paying back their Canada Student Loans until they are earning at least $25,000 per year. This will help young people as they transition into work, giving them a bit of a break until they land on their feet.

We’ll also support young people through significant new investments in skills training.

Previously, the Government of Canada was spending $330 million per year on youth employment. This year, we will invest almost twice that.

These are just a few of the things we have planned to help students and new workers transition to meaningful, well-paying work.

Investing in young Canadians is a smart bet.  I’m confident of that because I’ve seen what you’re capable of.

I’m reminded almost daily of your unparalleled empathy for others, and of your genuine commitment to equality and inclusion.  I have often said that Canada is a country that is strong not in spite of our differences, but because of them.   

This is true of Canada’s young people, and it is especially true of Indigenous youth.   We have a lot of work to do to make sure that all young people in Canada enjoy equal treatment and equal opportunity.

This work won’t be easy.  Things that matter seldom are.  But I’m confident that if Canada and its Indigenous partners work together on a nation-to-nation basis, we can and we will ensure that Indigenous youth have a strong voice in shaping their futures.

For our part, the government will invest $2.6 billion over the next five years in primary and secondary education on reserves, to help First Nations students learn and succeed.  

Every child deserves a quality education.  Equality and inclusion matters – no matter your background, no matter where you live.  Those are the principles that will guide the decisions we make as a government.

When I look at the students here today, I feel  proud, and confident, and frankly, I feel reassured.

You are the most educated, most connected, and most diverse generation that this country has ever seen.  You shape your communities in ways that couldn’t have been imagined even 20 years ago when I was in school.

I was in the first class at McGill where everyone was given an email address, and it had more numbers in it than my CEGEP math textbook.

But for you, technology is an asset, innovation is second nature, diversity is a source of strength, and collaboration is the expectation.

You are the leaders, not of tomorrow – but of today. Never forget this.

What you do, what you say, and the choices you make have the power to change the world.

Young people have long demanded more from their elected representatives and I’m here to tell you that our government expects no less of you.

We need your help.

Tell us your concerns.

Keep us focused.

And expect more than talk – demand action.

My friends, this is a collaboration.  Together, we’ll create a future that we can be proud of for generations to come.

Thank you.

Mr. President, First Lady, ladies and gentlemen. What an extraordinary honour it is to be here with you tonight.

Thank you so much for the warm welcome you have extended to Canada and the Canadian delegation, and to Sophie and me personally.

Your hospitality, and your friendship, means the world to us.

In thinking about what I wanted to say this evening, I came across a quote from President Truman, who shared these words with the Canadian parliament nearly 70 years ago.

He said that Canada’s relationship with the United States “did not develop spontaneously ... (It) did not come about merely through the happy circumstance of geography,” but was “compounded of one part proximity and nine parts good will and common sense.”

It’s that enduring good will and common sense that I believe defines our relationship to this day.

It’s what makes our constructive partnership possible.

It’s what allows us to respectfully disagree, and remain friends and allies on the few occasions we do  

For example, I would argue that it’s better to be the leader of a country that consistently wins Olympic gold medals in hockey. President Obama would likely disagree.

(To President) And yet you still invite us over for dinner. Because that’s what friends do.

But you know, now that I think of it, we’re actually closer than friends. We’re more like siblings, really. Born of the same parents, though we took different paths in our later years. We became the stay at home type. You grew to be a little more… rebellious.

I think the reason that good will and common sense come so easily is because we are – Canadians and Americans alike – guided by the same core values.

Values like cooperation and respect. Cooperation, because it keeps us safe and prosperous. And respect, because it’s the surest path to both safeguarding the world that we share and honouring the diverse people with whom we share it.

When it comes to security, for example, we agree that our countries are stronger – and the world is safer – when we work together. For more than half a century, we’ve joined forces to protect our continent. And we’ve been the closest of allies overseas for even longer, fighting together on the beaches of France, standing shoulder to shoulder with our European partners in NATO, and  now confronting violent extremism in the Middle East.

In every instance, we realized that our concerns were better addressed together than alone. And together, we have realized the longest, most peaceful, and most mutually beneficial relationship of any two countries since the birth of the nation-state.

It’s a relationship that doesn’t just serve our own interests – it serves the entire world.

Canadians and Americans also value economic interdependence, because we know that it brings greater prosperity to all of us.

Over $2.4 billion worth of goods and services cross the border every day – evidence of one of the largest and most mutually beneficial trading relationships in the world.

One of our most popular exports to the United States has been another Justin – Justin Bieber. Now, this kid’s had a great year. And of course, leave it to a Canadian to reach international fame with a song called “Sorry”.

Together, Canada and the US negotiated trade agreements that have expanded opportunities for our businesses, created millions of good, well-paying jobs for our workers, and made more products more affordable for more Canadian and American families.

We must never take that partnership for granted. I can promise you that my government never will.

Nor should we forget that our responsibilities extend beyond our own borders, and across generations.

That means getting rid of the outdated notion that a healthy environment and a strong economy stand in opposition to each other.

And it means that when it comes to issues like climate change, we need to acknowledge that we are all in this together. Our children and grandchildren will judge us not by the words that we said but by the actions that we took, or failed to take.

If we truly wish to leave to them a better world than the one we inherited from our own parents – and I know, Mr. President, that you and the First Lady want this as strongly as Sophie and I do – we cannot deny the science.  We cannot pretend that climate change is still up for debate.

And that’s why I’m so proud of the continental strategy we’ve negotiated to help take on this most serious challenge. It’s a blueprint for real progress. One that respects science and scientists. That takes meaningful, measurable steps to protect our environment and combat climate change. And it’s a plan that allows us to grow our economies as we do it.

Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership and your partnership in this.

And finally, we believe – Canadians and Americans – in the fundamental truth that diversity is a source of strength.  That we are thriving and prosperous countries not in spite of our differences, but because of them.

Canadians know this. It’s why communities across the country welcomed more than 25,000 Syrian refugees over the past four months.  Not as visitors or temporary citizens, but as Canadians. And Americans understand this, too.  It’s why each generation has welcomed newcomers seeking liberty and the promise of a better life.

We know that if we seek to be greater, we must do greater things. Be more compassionate. Be more accepting.  Be more open to those who dress differently, or eat different foods, or speak different languages.  Our identities as Canadians and Americans are enriched by these differences, not threatened by them.

On our own, we make progress. But together, we make history. Duty-bound, loyal, and forever linked. Whatever the future holds, we will face it together. Neighbours, friends, partners, and allies. That is our experience, and our example to the world.

Mr. President, thank you for all you have done these past seven years to preserve this most important relationship.  May the special connection between our two countries continue to flourish in the years to come. And may my grey hair come in at a much slower rate than yours has.

And with that, on behalf of 36 million Canadians, I propose a toast: to the President, to the First Lady, and to the people of the United States of America. Cheers.

Hello everyone. I would like to thank the ministers of National Defence, International Development, and Foreign Affairs for joining me here today for this important announcement.


Thank you Professor Schwab for your warm welcome and for bringing this impressive group together.

I’d like to take a moment to recognize a founder of the World Economic Forum and a great Canadian, Maurice Strong, who passed away just a couple months ago.

Maurice showed incredible leadership on a variety of issues facing the world today, and in particular early and compelling leadership on climate change.

Today, we are gathered here to contemplate whether we are in the early stages of a fourth industrial revolution.

What a breathtaking possibility that is.

Steam power changed the world utterly. So did electricity and more recently, computers. And now we may be on the cusp of change equal in magnitude and far swifter in pace.

New technology is always dazzling, but we don’t want technology simply because it is dazzling—we want it, create it and support it because it improves people’s lives.

If we didn’t build the public infrastructure in the early 20th century to support mass electrification only the wealthy would have had heat and running water. And with that, the creation of the middle class—the base of resilient economies—would never have happened.   

Technology needs to serve the cause of human progress, not serve as a substitute for it, or as a distraction from its absence.

Simply put, everybody needs to benefit from growth in order to sustain growth.

It’s not hard to see how the connections between computing, information, robotics, and biotechnologies could deliver spectacular progress. It’s also not hard to imagine how it could produce mass unemployment and greater inequality.

Technology itself will not determine the future we get. Our choices will. Leadership will.

I believe in positive, ambitious leadership. I don’t believe leaders should prey on the anxiety of the disenfranchised.

Leadership should be focused on extending the ladder of opportunity to everyone. On pursuing policies that create growth, and on ensuring that growth produces tangible results for everyone.

Positive leadership creates a virtuous cycle. The more results we achieve for people, the more we grow the middle class, and create real chances for those working hard to join the middle class, the more people will grant you a license for further ambition.   

We need to trust citizens. We need to give people the tools and ability to help them succeed.

The fourth industrial revolution will not be successful unless it creates real opportunity for the billions who weren’t able to join us here this week.

In Canada we get this.

We need education to enable people to learn, think, and adapt.

We need infrastructure that supports change.

We need policies that encourage science, innovation and research.

We need societies that recognize diversity as a source of strength, not a source of weakness.

And we need governments willing to invest in making all that happen, while recognizing the dynamic innovation that happens in the private sector.

Just look at Silicon Valley. It crackles with ideas and experimentation.

Diversity is a major reason for Silicon Valley’s creativity. It’s engineers and entrepreneurs come from all over the world. Each brings a different perspective. And when those diverse ways of seeing and thinking come together, they spark creativity.

Diversity fosters new ideas. New ideas generate the experimentation needed to make the most of the fourth industrial revolution.

And diversity is something leaders can do much about.

Recently, a New York Times reporter asked the president of Y Combinator—  major Silicon Valley startup funder—if any one school stood out as a source of graduates with sparkling new ideas. He said there is one. It is the University of Waterloo.

That’s Canada’s University of Waterloo.

Why does Silicon Valley look to it as a great source of brilliant minds and brilliant ideas?

It has high intellectual standards, of course. And it values entrepreneurship. But diversity is its indispensable ingredient.

Their students come from everywhere. Fully half the graduate engineering students are international.

And the University of Waterloo’s domestic students are drawn from Canada’s student population—one of the most diverse in the world.

Now many of you have reached out to me recently in thanks for Canada’s compassionate response to the Syrian refugee crisis.

But let me tell you something, when I welcomed those families to Toronto last month, I welcomed them as new Canadians and as the future of the Canadian economy.

Diversity isn't just sound social policy. Diversity is the engine of invention.

It generates creativity that enriches the world.

We know this in Canada. Frankly, our recent election reminded us all that people can respond to a positive, inclusive vision of society.

And that makes me profoundly optimistic and confident.

Canada was mostly known for its resources. I want you to know Canadians for our resourcefulness.

I would bet that almost all of you have Canadians in leadership positions in your companies—you may not know it because we don’t often shout it from the rooftops, some clichés about Canadians are true.  In fact, at least half of you have hired Dominic Barton at one point or another.

We have a diverse and creative population, outstanding education and healthcare systems, and advanced infrastructure. We have social stability, financial stability and a government willing to invest in the future.

It’s not a coincidence that Canada is always found at or near the top of lists that countries want to be at or near the top of.

Canada has something else that isn’t so easily quantifiable. Confidence.

Canadians are remarkably confident. We believe in progress. And we are willing to work very, very hard to make it happen.

Our natural resources are important, and they always will be. But Canadians know that what it takes to grow and prosper isn’t just what’s under our feet, it’s what between our ears.  

Our recent election showed that Canadians understand that confident countries invest in their future.  

And these days, it seems the global supply of confidence is dwindling.

Some now say that it is impossible to change the face of global inequality—we’ve gone too far down one road to alter our course and invest in shared prosperity.   

Others insist that climate change is reason to despair. It’s too late to avoid catastrophe, they say. Or the only way to avoid catastrophe is to abandon economic growth.

Still others question diversity. People of different cultures and languages cannot live together harmoniously, they say. Diversity means instability and insecurity. Diversity is dangerous.  

I don’t believe any of that.

We can grow the middle class so that those who study and work hard and save will be rewarded.

We can fight climate change without sacrificing growth and prosperity. In fact, our global push toward a low-carbon economy will produce new companies, new growth, and new prosperity.

And, yes, we can embrace diversity and the new ideas that spring from it, while simultaneously fostering a shared identity and shared values in safe, stable communities that work.

The one thing certain about the next industrial revolution is like the three that preceded it, it will bring enormous change.

If you are looking for a country that has the diversity, the resilience, the positivity and the confidence that will not just manage this change but take advantage of it, there has never been a better time to look to Canada. 

Good morning.

Thank you so much for your kind welcome.

Before I begin, I’d like to recognize the Algonquin Nation, on whose traditional territory we are gathering.  We acknowledge them as the past, present and future caretakers of this land.

Elders, youth, National Chief Bellegarde, members of the AFN executive and Chiefs-in-Assembly: thank you for the opportunity to be here with you today.

When I last joined you, in July of this year, I said that I hoped you’d invite me back, whatever my job title might be.

I’m so glad you took me up on that offer.

As you know, a few things have changed since we last met.  But I’m also struck by the things that endure.

Meeting with Canadians. 

Hearing your stories. 

And through those conversations, getting a better sense of what it is that people are going through.

You can’t be an effective Member of Parliament if you’re not doing those things each and every day.

And, that’s no less true when you’re Prime Minister.

The difference is that as Prime Minister, my government now has the opportunity to take that understanding and transform it into action.  Or as last week’s Throne Speech put it, “make real change happen.” 

One of the ways we will advance that agenda for real change is by making sure that the voices of Indigenous Peoples are heard in Ottawa.

That starts with our new Members of Parliament. 

Of the dozen Indigenous candidates that ran under my party’s banner during the last campaign, eight were elected to office. 

Of those eight, two – Hunter Tootoo from Nunavut and Jody Wilson-Raybould from Vancouver – are now serving as cabinet ministers.

They are joined at the cabinet table by an experienced and capable Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs, Carolyn Bennett.  Carolyn is new to that role, but as former Liberal critic for Aboriginal Affairs, she’s not new to the issues that matter to your members. 

But as you’ve heard me say before, it’s not just about individual people, or even individual governments.  What’s needed is nothing less than a total renewal of the relationship between Canada and First Nations Peoples.

During the election, I made a personal commitment to bring new leadership and a new tone to Ottawa.  

I promised Canadians real change.  That includes not just doing different things, but also doing things differently.  Including the way that we, as a government, approach our relationships with others.

History has shown that taking an adversarial approach is not only ineffective – it can be profoundly damaging.

Nowhere is this more obvious than in the government’s relationship with First Nations.

It is time for a renewed, nation-to-nation relationship with First Nations Peoples.

One that understands that the constitutionally guaranteed rights of First Nations in Canada are not an inconvenience but rather a sacred obligation.

One that is based on recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership. 

One that is guided by the spirit and intent of the original treaty relationship; one that respects inherent rights, treaties and jurisdictions; and one that respects the decisions of our courts.

I know that renewing our relationship is an ambitious goal, but I am equally certain that it is one we can, and will, achieve if we work together.

This is a responsibility I take seriously, and I have instructed my government to do the same.

In the mandate letters given to government ministers, my expectations were clear.  I told them that no relationship is more important to me and to Canada than the one with First Nations, the Metis Nation, and Inuit Peoples.

Today, I give you my word that we will renew and respect that relationship.

We will work with you to rebuild trust. 

We will tell the truth. 

When we make mistakes – as all governments do – we will acknowledge our mistakes and learn from them.  

And we will work together with First Nations as full partners, inspired by the values of mutual respect, sharing and caring.

To that end, I’ve given the new Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs very explicit directions on how to move forward. 

Among her top priorities will be the creation of a national public inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada.  

I am pleased to announce that that process is already underway, and an update on our progress will be provided to you by Ministers Bennett, Wilson-Raybould and  Hajdu this afternoon.

We have made this inquiry a priority for our government because those touched by this national tragedy have waited long enough.  The victims deserve justice, their families an opportunity to be heard and to heal.

We must work together to put an end to this ongoing tragedy. 

A second priority will be to make significant investments in First Nations education.  This is one funding area where we know we can’t afford to wait, and we won’t. 

Every child and young person living in Canada deserves a real and fair chance at success.  First Nations students are no less deserving.

At the same time, we will never impose solutions from the top down.  We know this approach is wrong, and we know it doesn’t work.  While we share a commitment to improving education outcomes, we believe that education reforms that affect First Nations children must be led by First Nations.

Third, as National Chief Bellegarde alluded to, our government will immediately – as part of our first budget – lift the two percent cap on funding for First Nations programs.  As you know, that limit has been in place for nearly 20 years.  It hasn’t kept up with the demographic realities of your communities, nor the actual costs of program delivery. 

It’s time for a new fiscal relationship with First Nations that gives your communities sufficient, predictable and sustained funding.  This is a promise we made, and a promise we will keep.

Fourth, and in partnership with Indigenous communities, the provinces, territories and other vital partners, we will fully implement the calls to action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, starting with the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

And fifth, we will conduct a full review of the legislation unilaterally imposed on Indigenous peoples by the previous government. Where measures are found to be in conflict with your rights, where they are inconsistent with the principles of good governance, or where they simply make no public policy sense, we will rescind them.

These are just five of the commitments we’ve made as part of our efforts to repair this most important relationship. 

There are many other actions we will undertake, from partnering with First Nations as we review and monitor major resource development projects to providing significant new funding to help promote, preserve, and protect Indigenous languages and cultures.

In every instance, we need your help.

We cannot close the gaps between the First Nations experience and those of others without a collaborative, nation-to-nation approach, like the one that resulted in the Kelowna Accord.

As leaders, that is a responsibility we share. 

Working together as partners, I am confident that we can make meaningful and immediate progress on the issues that matter most to your communities – things like education, housing, employment, health and mental health care, community safety, child welfare, and stewardship over our land, water and air.

Doing anything less is simply unacceptable. 

All our communities and all our children deserve the better future I know we can deliver if we work together.

As I said when we last met, a respectful, cooperative partnership is not only possible, it is a sacred responsibility inherited from past generations and entrusted to us by future ones.

I promise you that I will be your partner in the years to come, and hope that you will be mine.

Merci.


I am honoured to represent Canadians at this historic meeting. 

My message is simple. Canada can and will do more to address the global challenge of climate change.

We will do so because the science is indisputable, and tells us that our planet is already changing in ways that will have profound impacts on our future. 

And we will do so because it’s the right thing to do, for our environment and our economy, and as part of the global community.

Our government is making climate change a top priority, and our actions will be based on five principles.

First, we will act based on the best scientific evidence and advice.

Second, we will support and implement policies that contribute to a low-carbon economy, and this will include carbon pricing.

Third, and very importantly, we will work with our provinces, territories, cities and Indigenous leaders who are taking a leadership role on climate change. 

Indigenous peoples have known for thousands of years how to care for our planet. The rest of us have a lot to learn. And no time to waste.

But they are not alone. Canadian cities have also long been leaders in the fight to create clean growth and combat climate change. 

There’s a lot that we, in other orders of government, can learn from our cities.

Fourth, we will help the developing world tackle the challenges of climate change. 

Many of the world’s most vulnerable countries have done little to contribute to the problem, but face the most significant consequences. 

And all countries deserve the right to develop, and this development can and should be based on access to clean energy technologies.

Finally, we view climate change not just as a challenge but as an historic opportunity.

An opportunity to build a sustainable economy, based on clean technology, on green infrastructure, and on green jobs.

We will not sacrifice growth; we will create growth.  

I want to highlight the participation at COP 21 of several provincial and territorial premiers. 

Our provinces have taken a leadership role in Canada with regard to climate change. 

In the months to come, we will develop a pan-Canadian climate change framework, to assist us in  implementing the Paris agreement.

This will include national emissions-reduction targets and, more importantly, a concrete plan to achieve them.

Policy options will be informed by the best economic and scientific evidence. 

These options include carbon pricing, support for energy efficiency, clean electricity and transport, and sustainable buildings and infrastructure. 

Adaptation will be a core focus of our efforts. 

And the plan will be flexible to the circumstances and policy approaches of the provinces and territories. From cap-and-trade to a ban on coal-fired electricity generation. From world leading innovation on carbon capture and storage to a revenue-neutral carbon tax. 

We can learn from and build on these models.

We will also emphasize innovation. 

We will support sectors ranging from energy to forestry to agriculture, as they develop technologies to reduce emissions, create high-quality jobs, and contribute to long-term sustainable economic growth.  

Our plan will build on the efforts of local governments, indigenous organizations, businesses, youth, the academic community, and non-governmental organizations, many of whom will be represented in Paris in the coming days.

Canada will take on a new leadership role internationally.

We will participate in collaborative initiatives, such as Mission Innovation and the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition and we will seek out opportunities to work bilaterally or multilaterally, beginning with our North American partners.  

We believe climate finance is critical.

Our commitment of 2.65 billion dollars over five years towards initiatives will help developing countries reduce their emissions and adapt to climate change.

These efforts can bring about transformative change through increasing access to energy and poverty alleviation.

A Paris agreement should reflect a new reality.

The world has changed for the better.

Global development has increased at a rapid pace. 

But this means that we are going to need the efforts of those countries that are now in a position to help others reduce their emissions and adapt to climate change.

The agreement also requires a prominent role for the private sector and multilateral institutions to mobilize finance. 

Those who can act, must.

COP 21 provides an opportunity for leaders to overcome old divisions and forge an ambitious, meaningful agreement, and an effective path forward.

Collectively, we are already rising to the task, with more than160 countries representing over 90 percent of global emissions having committed to taking action. 

This is unprecedented. 

But the latest science tells us that we need to do more.

Canada looks forward to playing a constructive role at COP 21.

Our delegates are focussed on finding common ground to achieve an agreement with strong commitments and ambition, one that all parties are able to adopt and implement.

We have an opportunity to make history in Paris - an agreement that supports a transition to a low-carbon economy that is necessary for our collective health, security, and prosperity. 

Canada is back, my good friends. 

We are here to help. 

To build an agreement that will do our children and our grandchildren proud.

Thank you.


Quite a pleasure to be here, in London, with all of you today.

Thank you, High Commissioner Campbell, and all of the staff here at Canada House.

I also want to thank everyone here in the room, and all those joining us outside in the square, for taking the time to be with us today.
Earlier today, I had the opportunity to meet with Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
She was, of course, gracious and insightful, with a unique and valuable perspective. Her Majesty has been an important part of Canada’s history and, I am confident, will remain an important part of our continued progress and our future.

And it’s that future, and Canada’s role in our shared future, that I’d like to address today.

Canada has learned how to be strong not in spite of our differences, but because of them, and going forward, that capacity will be at the heart of both our success, and of what we offer the world.
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion isn’t about Canadians being nice and polite—though of course we are. In fact, this commitment is a powerful and ambitious approach to making Canada, and the world, a better, and safer, place.

Why diversity is important

It’s easy, in a country like Canada, to take diversity for granted. In so many ways, it’s the air we breathe.

We’ve raised generation after generation of children who think nothing of hearing five or six different languages spoken on the playground.

Because it’s 2015, people around the world are noticing the diversity of our Cabinet, and our Parliament. But the diversity of our country is not news.

An MP colleague of mine once told me a story that captures it perfectly. He was doing a parliamentary exchange program in Paris. There were elected representatives from around the world present. He was asked what Canada “looks like.”

He was accompanied by four other colleagues, none of whom except him were born in Canada. Among them were three women and two men. Two Catholics, an Ismaili Muslim, a Jew whose parents had survived the Holocaust, and a gay protestant minister. One was born in France, one in Portugal. Another was born in Argentina. Another in Tanzania.

He pointed to his colleagues and said: “Well, this. This is what Canada looks like.”

One-fifth of Canadians were born elsewhere, and chose to immigrate to Canada. In our largest city, more than half were born outside Canada.

Against that backdrop, the importance of diversity can sometimes be taken for granted. But there is no doubt that we’re a better country—a stronger, more successful country—because of it.

Just consider the words that people use to describe Canada: we’re open, accepting, progressive and prosperous. There is a direct line between each of those attributes and Canada’s success in building a more diverse and inclusive society.

We’re not the only nation that’s tried to do it. 

But what’s made it work so well in Canada is the understanding that our diversity isn’t a challenge to be overcome or a difficulty to be tolerated. 

Rather, it’s a tremendous source of strength.

Canadians understand that diversity is our strength. We know that Canada has succeeded—culturally, politically, economically—because of our diversity, not in spite of it. 

In typical Canadian fashion, we don’t celebrate this success often enough. 

But I would argue that now, more than ever, the world needs us to do just that. 

In the wake of horrific events like the recent attacks in Paris, as we renew our resolve to work with the international community to help prevent such attacks, and as we reaffirm our steadfast participation in the coalition against ISIL, we must also recommit to building a world where diversity and difference are promoted and celebrated.

We know that peace is possible, and that hope beats fear every single time.

How and why Canada does diversity best

Canada’s story proves that diversity and inclusion work. Not just as aspirational values, but as a proven path to peace and prosperity.

It hasn’t always been easy. We have had stumbles along that path.

We need to recognize that for Indigenous Peoples, the Canadian reality has not been—and is not today—easy, equitable or fair. 

We need to acknowledge that our history includes darker moments: the Chinese head tax, the internment of Ukrainian, Japanese, and Italian Canadians during the First and Second World Wars, our turning away boats of Jewish or Punjabi refugees, our own history of slavery.

Canadians look back on these transgressions with regret and shame—as we should.

But our history was also filled with many positive moments.

The Underground Railroad. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Multiculturalism Act. The Official Languages Act. The welcoming of Ismaili Muslims. The freedom for Jews and Sikhs, Hindus and Evangelicals to practice their religion as they choose.

These positive changes can never right historical wrongs. But they can serve to remind us that, in the phrase so beloved of Martin Luther King Jr., “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.”

Like many other nations, Canada faces a constant debate between those who would have us restrict, close ranks, and build walls—and those who remind us that we are who we are precisely because we are open diverse and inclusive. 

The last election campaign provides a good example. It was, in part, about whether Canadians still believe in those values. Many had their doubts. 

But let me tell you this. I’m standing here today as Prime Minister of Canada because Canadians rejected the forces that would divide us against ourselves.

But we don’t need a national election to see Canada’s commitment to diversity in action. 

We see it in our communities each and every day.

While a few allow themselves to be overwhelmed by anger and outrage, as a society, cooler heads and warmer hearts ultimately prevail.

Whenever, or wherever, a few seek to threaten those who look, or dress, or pray differently; many others stand up and say: “No. Not here. Not in our community, not to our neighbours.”

Time after time, when intolerance rears its ugly head, Canadians rise up to reject it. We prove—clearly and unflinchingly—that we are better than that.

I’d like to share with you a few very recent examples.

One day after the attacks in Paris, a mosque in Peterborough, Ontario, was set on fire—a suspected hate crime. In response, the community rallied, and raised more than $110,000 in two days to help the Muslim community rebuild. United in faith, members of local Christian and Jewish communities opened their doors—literally opened their doors—to give their Muslim neighbours a place to pray. 

Those are Canadian values.

In Kitchener, Ontario, a Hindu temple was vandalized—its windows smashed by rocks, while the congregation's head preacher attended a vigil for those who died in the Paris attacks. A Muslim group in the Toronto area started a fundraiser to help repair the damage.

Those are Canadian values.

The importance of a strong middle class

As important as these values are, they cannot exist in isolation. It’s essential that they are supported by economic policies that benefit Canadians.

Canada’s economy depends on a strong and growing middle class. This has always been the case.

In the last century, Canada’s growing and optimistic middle class created a big-hearted, broad-minded consensus. Together, these hard-working Canadians built a better country, not just for themselves, but for their children, and for each other.

By keeping our focus squarely on helping the middle class and all those who are working hard to join it, we can deliver real economic growth that will benefit all.

That’s a worthwhile goal in its own right, but it’s also important because we know that a diverse country doesn’t work without it.

When opportunities are limited, when people don’t think they have a real and fair chance to succeed, fear eats away at hope. Economic stress manifests itself in many ways. Fear and mistrust of others who are different is one of its most common, most dangerous, expressions.

In other words, middle class growth is much more than an economic imperative—it’s central to our unity as a nation.

It’s that shared sense of purpose that’s so hard to define but so deeply felt. The feeling that we are all in this together. The knowledge that wherever we came from, we are united not only in our struggles, but also in our dreams.

It is the middle class that unites us, and it’s our diverse communities that keep our economy growing. We need both to succeed.

Canada’s role in the world

Providing greater support to our middle class is an important domestic objective, but there is also a critical role for Canada to play in sharing its success with the world.

As the century unfolds, and as economic and environmental trends make migration between states the “new normal,” more and more countries will find themselves faced with challenges that Canada confronted long ago.We’ve

We’ve gotten an important thing right in Canada. Not perfect, but right. That thing is the balance between individual freedom and collective identity.

We know that people are defined in large part by our relationships to other people. Our cultural background, our gender, our religious beliefs, our sexual orientation.

However, we also believe that all of those collective associations receive their highest expression in the form of real, flesh and blood, individual human beings.

We expand cultural freedom by ensuring that individual Canadians who come from these diverse communities have the freedom to live and express and grow and change their cultures.

We refuse to see a contradiction between individual liberty and collective identity. In fact, we have created a society where both thrive, and mutually reinforce one another.

It was at its root, a leap of faith, and a very new idea. Over time, we learned to trust that whatever their culture of origin, the more people engage with the breadth of our country’s diversity, the more Canadian they will become.

Where there was repression, it would be defeated by the more compelling Canadian opportunity to achieve liberty. Where there was isolation, we would meet it with openness and inclusion.

It may have started as a leap of faith, but it has become a defining characteristic of our country, our great success, and arguably our greatest contribution to the world.

We have proven that a country—an astonishingly successful country—can be built on the principle of mutual respect.

In characteristically Canadian fashion, we don’t celebrate this success often enough. But the world needs us to do so. Especially now.One of the most difficult and urgent global problems is how to develop societies where people of different cultures can live together and build common ground. And collectively, we face the influx of refugees fleeing a violent conflict.

One of the most difficult and urgent global problems is how to develop societies where people of different cultures can live together and build common ground. And collectively, we face the influx of refugees fleeing a violent conflict.

Yesterday, our government laid out a plan that would see 25,000 Syrian refugees approved for resettlement by the end of the year, with all expected to arrive in Canada within a few months.

We’ve done it before. Under Prime Minister Joe Clark in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Canada resettled nearly 60,000 refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.

We’ve done it before, and we will do it again, because we know that we are not just resettling refugees, we are welcoming new Canadians.

And more, Canada can also export the ideas and institutions that make diversity work so well at home.

We know how to govern in a way that is inclusive, transparent, respectful and effective. We can share that expertise with other countries and their citizens. 

We know how to work cooperatively with our allies to combat terrorism, and how to be an effective partner in international peace operations. We can contribute more to those international efforts, and have committed to do so.

And we know how to do what former UN Secretary General Annan called for in 2013: “learn from each other, (and make) our different traditions and cultures a source of harmony and strength, not discord and weakness.” 

We have a responsibility—to ourselves and to the world—to show that inclusive diversity is a strength, and a force that can vanquish intolerance, radicalism and hate.

Canada’s success as a diverse and inclusive nation didn’t happen by accident, and won’t continue without effort.

The future is never certain. It depends on the choices we make today.

Compassion, acceptance, and trust; diversity and inclusion—these are the things that have made Canada strong and free. Not just in principle, but in practice.

Those of us who benefit from the many blessings of Canada’s diversity need to be strong and confident custodians of its character.

Let us not close our hearts to those in need, nor our minds to the knowledge that better is always possible.

We are, after all, Canadian.

Let’s show the world the very best of what that means.

Thank you.
